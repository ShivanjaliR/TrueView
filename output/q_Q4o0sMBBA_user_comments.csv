"Donald made statements that he will reduce taxes again, ok Donald. How is that going to fund infrastructure? Not much common sense act here. I see in Freeport, TX. If is was not for Dow chemicals and other corporation They would not have a votech department.  a example when you take away responsibility(Taxes) Now corporation has control over what the public school , The same way Dow chemical has control over the buisnise in the stocks Dow holds. We are going back to 1800 when corporation control the towns. You have to common sense in order to bring common sense. You are a molester, your wife is close to same age as your son. To me . That is a molester act.
This is a great example different between Democrats and republicans. The Democrats act as adults and the republicans acts as juvenile delinquent.  When Donald lost to Biden. He cause chaos., Juvenile delinquent act. Yet a adult act as we see here from Biden.( Democrat)

"HMMMMM ??  WHY DID KAMALA LOSE BY SUCH HUGE MARGINS????  THE  MEDIA-CONTROLLED LEFT RADICALS WILL LIE TO COVER IT UP BUT I WILL TELL YOU...

First of all, for all of the women out there WHO DID NO RESEARCH and just voted for her because she has the same genitalia as you, does not mean that she should be President. WOW...

She OFFERED NO answers as to why she still wants to over-fund extremely unnecessary wars like the Palestine and Ukraine War by wasting many billions of dollars paid for by our US citizen's income tax, instead of intelligently redirecting all of those billions to helping this country's REAL PROBLEMS LIKE our economy, healthcare, and homelessness problems. 

INSTEAD, she focuses on WASTING more BILLIONS of our money by placing our good soldiers' lives in jeopardy by PUTTING THEM IN COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY WARS TO SATISFY her militant and gross appetite for WAR!

She KNOWINGLY spreading toxic, damaging, and false information regarding Trump and the Russian hoax WHICH HAS ALL BEEN DEBUNKED!!

She doesn't plan on having real answers as to why she is committed to having free speech censored nor why she wants to give Big Pharma and related companies COMPLETE control of what we take and don't take. 

She IS SO CORRUPT THAT SHE IS COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR the illegal immigrant problem as she not only is STILL encouraged them to come, but FLYING MIGRANTS TO SWING STATES TO FAST-TRACK CITIZENSHIP BY PERSUADING THEM TO VOTE BLUE IN EXCHANGE FOR supplying them with free money, American jobs, credit cards, healthcare, cell phones, and more, STILL paid for by real US citizens.

THE TOXIC LEFT RADICALS ARE STILL PLANNING ON IMPORTING MIGRANTS to SWING STATES BEYOND THE ELECTION TO INFLUENCE THE NOW DANGEROUS AND TOXIC LEFT DEMOCRATIC VOTE!! THAT'S ILLEGAL, COMPLETELY FRAUDULENT AND ALREADY PROVEN!!

 SAY GOODBYE TO A 2 PARTY SYSTEM (DEMOCRACY). WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE DEMOCRACY AS THIS AGENDA WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD and eliminate the republican party.

I understand why you would perceive that to be a reality, but Trickledown Economics doesn’t work, there is no study showing it actually improves the lives of the lower and middle class. You are letting a politician destroy the lower classes at the benefit of the ultra-wealthy.']",2024-11-06T23:35:01Z,@RosaAllen-i7q

"Very cool! In this election the Republican Party rightfully takes the win. Thank god, everything went good this time. I think Trump will do a very good job. Now I want to make a differentiation that is trend setting especially along with this presidential election. Hopefully no one gets angry when I say the following. On the one hand so called early abortions should be legal in the special case if the woman got sexually raped. But on the other hand any abortions beyond the case of rape should definitely keep forbidden. Also rapists should be punished much more severely. I want to mention an important component. Harris wanted to legalize abortion in every case, and I am against this kind of legalisation, even though I am an LGBTI activist. Therefore I really am glad that Harris did not win. Yes, you heard correctly. 

Also fighters for LGBTI rights like me can be against so called late abortions and against abortions in the non raped cases, and can be against the too direct access to contraception, and against the sex industry as we can see in Nevada in a horrific extent. All these brothels should be abolished right away. Prostitution and the complete sex industry shall go away and shall not come back. Yes I am honest. I say the truth. These are my real opinions. I am in favor of LGBTI movement but I am against sexualisation. So in this time voting for Republican party is the better choice indeed. Nowadays this party with elephant symbol really suits me, it fits to me. 

I am an LGBTI activist and fight for rights of homosexual and intersexual persons, but I am also a biblically faithful Christian. These are even two reasons why I am even happy about the fact that, in the end of the speech, the famous YMCA song aka CVJM song was played:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grAk4d2yPyk     It is a beautiful song. And it is indeed an even very important connecting link between the biblically faithful christian movement on the one side and the LGBTI movement on the other side. Therefore playing this song at the end of the Trump speech is a very good sign that the Republican party really is engaged to cooperate with the bible orientated christian movement and also with the movement of LGBTI people in the same way. And the Republican party really is engaged in promoting the dialogue between biblically christian movement and LGBTI movement. That really makes me happy. It definitely is the right thing that the Republicans are the true winners. I am glad about the election result. 🌈⛪🌈⛪🌈⛪🌈⛪🌈⛪",[],2024-11-06T22:12:23Z,@emiljannbrahmeyer

"The ChristoFascists won, the loudest and dumbest hillbillies in the world have shown the rest of the world that America is stupid and even a corrupt, child diddler, conman, felon, can be president.  Don't even bother responding, bootlickers.","[""I don't know how people keep forgetting that dumb people are still the majority in this country"", ""\u200b@@UZiBLASTER7Many would rather have easy scapegoats, focus on their hatreds and watch conspiracies than learn the history of our own country. On top of that, many don't pay attention regardless to the issues across the country. Like the abortion bans, many refuse to see the truth that these bans not just hurt the mothers but the baby as well. They either haven't heard of these happenings, don't believe it or are okay with it. We had the third party vote being partly to blame as well as people NOT VOTING. The Harris campaign did about the best it possibly could, tho the cold reality is that people give up on voting for valid reasons. That mindset needs to change, as not all candidates are the same people to begin with and even when it comes to things like wars, what matters most before our opinions on global affairs are the issue that effect us here at home. The only truly stupid ones are the ones that know all of these facts and pretend that's not reality. Or those that are hateful and just in general, not the America we are. Regardless of how many Americans there are like that. I can even understand those being suck into rabbit holes in this day and age misinformation is rampant. Many make it out, many don't.

Fix mental health, build new treatment facilities with staff that actually want to help the patients, have at least 3 or 4 pharmacists (bc they know more about medications then any other doctor) and hire doctors with long experience with mental health patients. Stop hiring these ""helpers"" with a GED that know nothing about the medical field,  cause thats what they do and those people end up taking advantage of the patients and make it painfully obvious they dont care if the patient dies or not",[],2024-11-06T15:35:12Z,@JamieShirley-t8k

"Trump ran the campaign that he needed to run. He stayed on message. He drove the message of the economy and immigration. This message resonated with the middle class and specifically white middle class women, Latinos/Hispanics men, and Black men.  The Democrats message was muddled. No one knows what they were going to do. The only clear Democratic message was abortion, and they presented that argument horribly.  Now the Democrats will blame the loss on misogyny, racism, nationalism, etc. as reasons for the loss. If we are honest, some of those issues were factors but not at the level that Democrats are whining about.  The Democrats ran a horrible campaign and that's why VP Harris lost.

When I found out he won it, I will admit i started crying... these last 4 years have been absolutely horrible for me,  I Lost my home due to Cost of living and housing rise,  I had to live in my car for 3 months, I had to give up my house, home and everything i knew and loved about the state I lived my whole life in and moved across the country.  Where I spent 3 months there in my car,  spent time in a homeless shelter, Finally got into a place but couldn't fill up my refrigerator or have any food on hand for 8 months, I ate 1 meal a day down at the shelter.  When Donald was in before I was in the best Shape, had no issues with housing, finances, keeping food on my table.  the last 4 years was a disaster for me, and i am slowly trying to recoop my loses.  I cannot wait to see what happens these next 4 years, I wish you all prosperity and happiness!!",['I pray things turn around for you. Keep the faith in our Lord Jesus.

"He made history by beating to women, Clinton and Harris, but had a hard time winning against a male candidate. Businesses will not lower their prices or wages, wake up Americans, trump couldn’t get rid of the gangs and cartels and jails filled to capacity at the end of 2020. Drilling, Trump could never get that done, nobody will let him drill in their backyard! Lawsuits will push it past his presidency and he won’t be able to do it! Gas would be more expensive drilling here and companies will charge more. Cheaper to import with no tariffs! If trump increases tariffs, America will pay for it. Economics people!

"Remember, if you ever feel hopeless, look for the helpers. They are around you even in dark times. They will fight alongside you. Don't let fear win. Mobilize and make a plan. Research politics extensively and watch for the warning signs. Stock up on birth control and plan B. Plan B lasts for a couple of years if you keep it stored away. Network and form carpool systems with nurses, doctors, gynecologists, lawyers, to get out of your state/country for lifesaving reproductive care. Get a passport. And research how to seek asylum.

Discuss a school/work escape plan with check points for your dreamer friends. Don't talk to the police as they are there only to enforce the law. Regardless of if the law is ethical or not. 

Try to limit the amount of personal information you put online as that could be collected by the government to find/ identify you, prosecute you, ect. PRACTICE FREE speech. But anonymously. Those who speak the truth have a tendency to make enemies, and disappear in prison or worse.

When the empire collapses, it does so slowly and you may not think the situation is bad until its at your doorstep. So watch and plan. Comfort your friends and be brave.",[],2024-11-06T08:54:53Z,@RavenFeathers90

Kamala Harris left without speaking to her supporters who were standing in their party venue for over 7 hours. They were told to go home by one of the Harris officials. What a sour puss.
