"I'm not the biggest fan of Trudeau. Although Pierre says that he wants to cut the carbon tax, when we receive rebates anyways - and it is hardly the driver of inflation. Showing rates as low as 1/54th of inflation during the pandemic. Carbon tax isn't the best solution to fighting climate change, but it's far quicker than policies. (which Pierre will set back decades of climate goals when he does ""axe the tax."") 

The only real change that needs  to come from this carbon tax is putting higher rebates into the pockets of the less wealthy. While taxing more and more the bigger corporations, in order to reach our climate goals. If we get rid of this economic incentive to stop polluting, companies will take full advantage and use more oil and natural gas than ever.",[],2024-11-09T12:42:13Z,@Radman2617
