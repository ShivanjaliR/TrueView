I commented on one of astros videos before moonbin died. I noticed how he was a bit negative. I knew from that point we had to save him! I spammed on the Astro videos saying “protect moonbin” but not many listened. Some asked me why so I explained and they spammed as well. Eventually I think YouTube deleted those comments I’m not sure but we couldn’t find them. Later on a few days later I got a notification of a video of moonbin being carried dead. I knew it was suicide and so I was literally crying! We lost a star! He was my bias from Astro!❤❤❤😢😢😢 please protect Lisa and the rest! I think Lisa may do this as she hadn’t renewed her contract. She may leave and than commit suicide. It’s just my thought so please do not attack me. Blackpink is an amazing group. Also I am translating this from Korean to English.

Let me tell u how its gonna happen and pls dont blame me bcs its my personal opinion...

1) Making people believe that buying gucci and wearing sone rich clothes dining in big restaurants...moving in cars worth billions will make u happy...Hell no bcs THE SAD REALITY IS EVEN THE RICHEST RICH ARE WITH THE WORST MENTAL HEALTH...And THAT all is said by increasing suicides occuring in kpop during these years!!

2)Listening to their music consisting of some hypnotising verses that u want to listen to it again and again such that u get addicted so badly...And lose focus...Trying to be perfect according to theirs beauty standard and constantly pleading to becone like them to makr ur skin look like them flawless...lastly  dissapointed distraught with urself with minimum self esteem of ur looks decides to go for a plstic surgery!!!

Dont you guys dare lie if u follow kpop vdos and havr never ever thought once ABOUT THE SURGERY THING 

3)Following these idols watching and revisiting their vdos again and again...And that person doesnot even know u exist...

"SUICIDE: From frying pan to fire (from earthly temporary short sufferings, to eternal hell).

My journey to life.

Life is gift, not to be rejected. Life is a privilege. Only one life. Live. Help available. Soul is worth more than the value of world. What profits a man, if he gains whole world, but loses his soul.

Nothing disqualifies anyone from the love of God.

Finding God helps find meaning, purpose, hope, acceptance, love, eternity, human value, human dignity, equality, God-given talents, family values, health, rest, peace, joy, compassion. Finding God prevents suicides. 

Sin is pre-existing in all. Nobody taught us to sin. Sin pre-dates The Bible. The Bible explains origins of sin. The Bible provides remedy for pre-existing sin, through Jesus Christ death and resurrection. The Bible is best selling book in the world for this reason.

Sin is real, The Bible is relevant. Sin is born with every child birth.

Sin is disease of heart, and Jesus Christ is the cure.

We love truth when it enlightens us, but hate when it convicts us.

Instructing to ""Heart wash"" from sin is not ""Brainwash"".

God created universe, placed natural laws, made man in His image, gave talents, instructed man to multiply and explore - The Initiation of Science. Science is the legitimate child of natural laws.

We are made with good purpose and meaning. We are good. Then sin entered and we all fallen. Disease, despair, deformities, deficiencies, depression, stress, guilt, greed, hate, anger, rebellious spirit, spiritual death entered. Sin plays spoilsport.

Satan is the enemy, came to steal, kill and destroy. It subtly misleads us to blame good loving God. God is not the author of evil.

Freedom in ""sin"" is not freedom, it is bondage. Freedom from ""sin"" is ultimate freedom.

Stay away from sin and satan to have peaceful life.

Penalty of sin already paid by Jesus Christ on The Cross.

Nobody died for our sins and resurrected - except Jesus Christ. Exclusivity.

Jesus Christ has authority to forgive sins.

God loves the sinner, but hates sin. Just like a parent loves child, but hates disease of child.

Salvation from sin and hell is not earned through works or deeds or pilgrimages or rituals or ceremonies or traditions or cultures or public displays or making personal sacrifices or making animal sacrifices.

We are saved by God's Grace, not by our works.

Heaven is holy, sin cannot enter. Jesus Christ came from heaven, made entry to heaven easy and free. In heaven there is no more pain, no more deformities, no more deficiencies, no more death, no more tears.

Unable to find any motive any reason for Jesus Christ to die on The Cross and resurrect - except His love to save us from pre-existing sin, and hell. For free.

Jesus Christ suffered, ridiculed, spat-on, punched, humiliated, wrongly accused, crucified on The Cross. He endured all to save us from sin and shame. He experienced sufferings first hand, therefore He understands our sufferings. He raised victorious, we will too. Those who endure till the end are victorious. 

There are solutions to problems. There are so many talents, avenues, opportunities we have to explore. 

We are weak, and we have God to trust and hope in our weaknesses.

GRACE: Getting what we don't deserve - i.e. forgiveness of sin, eternity in heaven.

MERCY: Not getting what we deserve - i.e. punishment of sin, separation from God, eternity in hell.

God offers grace and mercy for free through Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. We are saved by God's grace, not by our works.

Consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.

It is a lie to say that we are not loved. God loves us unconditionally. He died willingly on The Cross and resurrected, to save us from pre-existing sin and hell.

The God who died for us, is for us. God is not against us.

The world honours success, and God honours faithfulness. For God our souls and their eternity are important.

Following God's morals have health, psychological and economic benefits, to individuals, families and nations. Following God's morals provide equilibrium. Following rules helps.

There is more to life.

Never found a sentence that is comforting on a death-bed - anywhere else.

Death is scary thing, but eternal damnation is scarier. 

Death is not extinction, but accountability.

Jesus Christ coming again to judge all. The doors will be closed. Jesus Christ reveals every mystery, answers every question. He is The Alpha and The Omega. He judges everyone.

One day every knee shall bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. 

The First Coming of Jesus Christ - He is Lamb, slaughtered for remission of sins to save us from sin and hell. And resurrected. He remains Lamb for now.
The Second Coming of Jesus Christ - He will be Lion, The Judge. The Lion and The Lamb.

Jesus Christ forgave all who crucified Him, and now forgives all, even who reject, ridicule and mock Him. He loves all unconditionally, He wants us to repent of our pre-existing sins and have heaven for free. He knows our weaknesses and still loves us.

Believe, trust, repent of pre-existing sin in Jesus Christ that He died for remission of our sins and resurrected, and coming back to judge, accept Him as Lord and Saviour, and be saved from sin and hell. Any time, any where. Even now. Simple. 

Nothing to lose, everything to gain.

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

I found God of Bible loved me unconditionally, regardless of my sins, weaknesses, depressions and rejections by others. I am not in competition with others. He believed me and has faith in me. God loves you too, individually.

I came to know the Loving God, who knows everything.

(My journey to life journal - after testing all 'isms' and religions, after failing to find origins and purpose and meaning of life, after swallowing pride, egos, anger, hate, shame, depression.)","['Got a religious fanatic.Where did Sulli go after?, it is up to God to decide, but you imagining a seed  who could decide for it will surely go to hell (there is no doubt about this in the Bible text) so that you won`t do it no matter how long the Pharisee texts are written.']",2020-03-23T18:12:54Z,@rmk2879

"There is something fundamentally wrong with Kpop Idols and how they are treated by people and handled by their companies and Fans dont think you're completely innocent. You're the reason they have to work Overtime basically their whole lives. They have to pretend they're okay with that and smile even though they get half the sleep we do and work tirelessly on choreography, singing and touring. They have no real lives of their own as they start off in the industry way too young and having to look pretty every single time they go out in public which severely messes up with people's confidence and their ability to shake things off. Their stress is enough to break most people. So yes. Words that would be laughed at or ignored by basically all pop stars around the world are way more effective on already over worked tired, stressed and depressed Kpop idols.

Stop supporting their industry. It's a poison on their youth and demands unrealistic expectations from them. There is a reason why they're amongst the highest in suicide rates.",[],2019-11-25T00:44:41Z,@TallicaMan1986

You people are the reasons for deaths like these. Imagine how many people in the world are crying because of you people. She has her own reasons for doing things. We all do things that are weird okay? If you think that any Kpop idol is ugly, and you think you’re better than them then why don’t you become a kpop idol? Why dont you feel the stress that they feel? Don’t judge people by your own standards. She was loved by so many people and now she’s gone. Gone forever. She’s never coming back.She never did anything to you. Look at what you’ve done. If you’re a fan of f(x) and Sulli,  then I’m so sorry you had to take in these big news. But she’s in a better place now. Where no one can hurt her. Now, don’t think I’m hating on the haters right now. I haven’t even talked about the company yet.

Wrong! Society in general, will remain a constant factor. The difference maker is the people around your circle(family, friends, partner, including yourself). Society will never adjust for someone's comfort but you have your family to teach you how to live strong against adversities, kinds of friends that you allow *yourself* to be surrounded with and a lifetime partner, who is willing to take half of every emotion you go through (pain, sorrow, joy, fear, etc.) Cyberbullying alone *never* killed someone. Its the failure of oneself and the people around that someone in equipping him/her enough to face this harsh world of reality.

"I guess people who commit suicide because of depression do it because aside from the fact that it's already too hard to bare, at least when they die, people who truely love them gather and there they will see, who and how many love them..despite all the people who hate them...I feel sad for this fact and I fully understand..but this I tell you, even if the world turns its back on you, and even if your only friend is none other but yourself, HAVE FAITH...and ALWAYS PRAY. It maybe difficult but when you feel like you wanna end your life, remember that it's not yours to take because we only borrowed it from God..and it's Him who should decide when to take it from you. Go to church and there you cry and sob and you may even talk to a priest and ask for a piece of advice. You can travel and discover things that rather could make you continue to live your life.  Remember that life sucks sometimes but God loves us and He does not give us something He knows we cannot overcome. You may be given this life....because you are strong enough to live it. Just hang on. He will end your sufferings soon because the best in life for you is yet to come.
He ended mine...and now I'm on my way to battle for my dream of becoming a lawyer. 

Visit my channel and watch my latest vlog on failure and having faith. Soon I will upload another prescription for life. I'm not a life coach and I'm not even a professional motivational speaker but I hope I can be one of God's instrument also to help grow strength in other people's heart, mind, body and soul.

And Sulli does all of that.', ""@@shimmyshimmykokopopithinki6403 That doesn't mean you blame her, that's victim-blaming. Blame the antis, blame the people who were being hurtful, blame people for being ignorant. You're seriously criticizing someone who committed suicide and had a mental illness instead of the actual problem? You don't know what a mental illness works, it's not a choice to have depression, it's not a choice to feel like she can't reach out to us .When she tried that, antis were even angrier. It's the society that surrounded her is what the issue was. Clearly, you show no empathy towards those who have mental illnesses or suicidal thoughts.

"Update: 
The police need to do a full investigation. These sad events always bring up the question of: "" where was Sulli family all these years"",  ""why no roommate"" , were any large life insurance contact taken out on her life by anyone close to her. It seems like a perfect crime scenario  given her past history of depression.  Example:

THE QUAID CONSPIRACY: “I GUESS SOME IDOLS ARE WORTH MORE TO ’EM DEAD THAN ALIVE""


“They decide, O.K., if we knock off an Idol, then what we can do is simply collect the insurance covering their participation in the television or drama show that they were working on overseas,”  “It’s almost moronic, it’s so simple.”  



They’re spending nights in their car, on the run from the same shadowy cabal—“the Hollywood Star Whackers”—who may have killed Heath Ledger, possibly sabotaged Jeremy Piven, and could now be targeting Lindsay Lohan. No, this is not the plot of Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner Randy Quaid’s latest movie. It is what he and his wife, Evi, swear is really happening to them. With the Quaids in Canada, the author probes their nightmare reality, which has alienated friends and family, and turned the couple into outlaws.



The “Whackers,” they said, were the same people who may have “killed” David Carradine and Heath Ledger, possibly set up Robert Blake, and could now be targeting Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. “Are either of you mentally unstable, schizophrenic, or on drugs?,”

Honestly I don’t know who to blame for their deaths, i can even blame myself for it. SM should’ve learned their lesson with Jonghyun passing. They should’ve been more considerate of their idols, I mean the life that they have is such a hassle, it would’ve been better for them to be able to talk about it and have them understand, but no one did. I for one knows exactly how that feels to be like that, to have no one to run to, to have no one with open arms and open ears, this really does affect everything you do and everything around you, and that’s why I feel like that was just the main reason, that receive the hate and got put down so many time to where they just gave up.

"the fact that sm knew of her past and it is and was a prominent thing that she talked about once or twice but them not to take action and sulli herself asked sm to take down the hateful comments and the DIDNT is just just disgusting . she is a human and should’ve been treated like a human throughout her whole career, and what if she wasn’t wearing under garments , it’s her business and something she wanted to change . so many signs to her ending , her crying multiple  Times on her lives and no one not even her own company can at least give her something like therapy , we don’t know what we don’t know. so for people to still be hating on her because of something like not wearing a bra or cutting her hair short is just immature and costed someone their whole life , costed someone’s daughter , granddaughter , maybe sister , who knows . idols have a very hard life to just have a 0.000000000.1% of exploding towards Koreans and now us is so precious. they have worked their asses off and for them to not get a good payback or ion know to be recognized could be so so disappointing. just because you don’t personally like a group doesn’t mean you have to go and hate on them . you don’t know what they are good at and are bad at let alone their past . and for someone to do that to her and heck we are seeing signs of jennie and two other female artists (sorry I can’t remember names ) of depression or I’m not a doctor but they are in huge need of help . we only see what’s on the outside this is why us fans are so defensive which we have to do. starting fan wars and ship wars what ever , at the end of the day sulli has left us for no complete reason . it’s hard to admit but we have ended her own life it’s not fair the people she was trying to get gratification from and good feedback was just chewing at her one by one when the people who hated on her for just her being her own self was built up so much ? What else would you do ? A chance to relieve yourself and leave everything  sulli was lost in her own mentality and we noticed too soon . We are just caught up with our newer gen of idols (no shade I love all of them ) but kpop is a cruel industry . if this company sm is the soul reason for us loosing two members of the biggest og groups they have to pay consequences.

Stop competing with each other for who can have the most plastic surgery, the biggest eyes, the highest nose, the ""smallest"" face, etc. It is so fucking shallow!

Hateful comments alone aren't enough to drive someone to the edge, and if we focus too much on it we may miss the other factors that caused Sulli to do what she did.

"Here is my unpopular thought
I think she died naturally, and if it was suicide then its because of depression not because of hate comments. She never cared about hate comments, and kept posting on instagram whatever she wanted, and lived happily as she liked. She knew what triggered netizens but still posted what she already knew she will recieve hate comments from. She didnt disable comments on instagram. And I am sure she already preducted the reaction of every post or picture she shared. She isnt stupid, and she was actually strong and dont care what netizens think.

"Sulli didn't kill herself, the people who thoughtlessly spout nonsensical hateful comments towards her are the ones that killed this girl. They've driven her to a corner. No matter how mentally or emotionally strong a person is, if you are continuously bombarded with hateful comments whatever you do, then you will really lose hope and even question your existence. *I am utterly disgusted with their inhumane behavior and attitude!*
I'm not a fan of Sulli but everytime I saw an article about how she's being harassed by the knetizens, it angered me. I always thought, ""Can't they just leave her be and let her live how she wants. Don't they have better things to do than hating her?"". 
Poor girl, she lived in a close-minded, unreasonably perfectionist society. 
Rest in Peace, Choi Jin Ri.

"The most shocking thing is that mental health issues are still a taboo on Korea and a lot of Asian countries. Why? I don't know. There should be a revolution, why is it so bad to say you're mentally exhausted and ill? It's not easy to battle depression, not everyone ever overcome it and to be able to know you can talk about it openly with your family, friends or a health care professional can be lifeline for you at some point.

"Don’t get it twisted. The bullying starts in their own companies by their producers and spills out into the public. They are pushed at no matter the cost and then when they need the most help they are pushed to the side. When they get to a certain age their considered old and useless and so on to the next younger group. It must have been such a lonely path for her not being protected from these netizens. It couldn’t have helped her depression working on that show hearing nasty, negative comments all the time either. For those who write malicious comments, It may not matter to people that because of your words someone took their own life but it matters to God that you are now bloodguilty and he will repay. It’s a sad state to be guilty in front of the almighty. We may hide who we are in the internet but not from him. That said I will say I don’t care who agrees or disagree with me but one thing I do care about is all those suffering from depression and anxiety so a word to them. YOU ARE WORTH IT! Don’t give up and don’t give in. Keep looking for help. Find a doctor, and friends, family who will listen and don’t stop. You will succeed if you don’t give up.

"Tbh i always knew Sulli was struggling with depression but I never really knew how bad it was until I just read that she passed away. And honestly the reason really isn't something that no one knows about. Everyone knows she's been cyberbullied immensely and everyone knows how ""brave"" she was for speaking out about how she wasn't bothered by any of the ridiculously harsh words they said. I never for once believed that she wasn't bothered. 

It pains me to see such a young, beautiful and talented woman, that was just being herself, had decided to take her life. For what reasons I do not know, but I'm certain that malicious comments were a factor. Up until this day it's ridiculous how people still do not realise the power that they have. A small rock will not hurt me; but if I were to have millions thrown at me? I would be bloodied up and in so much pain. 

Guys, mental health is not a joke. Take a moment and think about whether or not your words can hurt people. Does it feel great? Knowing that you've taken away a lifetimes worth of joy from someone? Knowing that you're the person that has forced someone into thinking that taking away their life is the only option left?

Sulli was one of those people that got me into a whole world of music. I loved her personality on shows and I loved her message often brought up about cyberbullying. I loved that she was strong, was herself, and that she never let the words define her.

But, as someone who idolised that person, imagine how devastating it was when I found out that she succumbed to the things that she spoke up about. I will never blame her. I blame the people that pushed her to the edge.",[],2019-10-15T11:40:40Z,@chloecheah4194
"She got hate and backlash from cyberbullying from her being open about her struggles as a Korean idol, and how the cycle of abuse and much more continues throughout being in this type of industry. Why people took it open themselves to be so hateful is beyond me. It baffles me how ungrateful we are that we treat the people who struggle for our entertainment like this. How about a freaking thank you? And some goddamn respect. Knowing good damn well the majority of people who act so hateful like this towards someone like her, couldn't even spend half a minute in her position. So just be grateful you don't have to be where she is, and was. Not to mention how the mental health issues in Korea are very much just not talked about and is just swept under the rug until it's too late.

With Mina struggling in JYP and even the rest of Twice saying they've experienced anxiety, to other artists expressing they've dealt with depression before, I really feel these companies must do more to address the mental and emotional health of their artists.

"To me there is much more than just online bullying and harassment that cause Sulli to be in deep depression,  but it is her agency also cause her to be that way.  Kpop companies have a reputation of putting   these most  of these  idols and trainees in  this depression mode  by having slave contracts,  pressuring them, and even bullying them.  I've just heard that they've made an autopsy about Sulli, and they said the it was unexpected death. So in other words, they don't want fans to know what really caused her death.   We will never get the truth from the law enforcement,  the corporate media, and SM itself.     I am very sorry for what happened to Sulli.  This is a shocking news!  Depression is a very painful thing to carry in your life.  It is also painful when you have mean spirited  people triggering your depression to make you feel worse.

First Jonghyun, and then she ... to be honest, I knew Jonghyun well before his death, but I informed myself about him, and about his farewell letter, and so on ... what I found out about Sulli,  that she debuted in 2009 in a girl group called f (x).  In 2014, the group broke up, and Sulli decided for the acting career.  (Of course, she still made music) She also became known as an actress.  She campaigned for women's rights, but got a lot of hate ... people made her down.  In a video, she cried, saying that she was not a bad person.  Yesterday, her manager found her dead in her house.  Cause of death: suicide .... Our society is guilty of her death.  She had depression.

""Pervert"" even if she was fat , she looked beautiful. If she was not energetic, u should know that humans are comlpicated based on different energy levels, bodies, thoughts and situation.  Idols should know that jealous people are everywhere. They should be strong and just focus on the love of true fans.

"First off, I just wanted to say I am just shocked that this happened, I mean it’s just the saddest way to leave earth. Like suicide is from being depressed, desperate, and oppressed, I know exactly how it feels to be like that, where there is no hope. No matter who run to or where, you’ll still end up finding your self still feeling like that, and it feels like you can’t do anything about it. I didn’t know her nor heard of her until today, but I was on the exact same boat as her, still am, but doing better piece by piece, anyways I just wanted to say even though she was an idol and presented herself as if she’s doing ok, she wasn’t and as heard mentioned it many times that she was hurting, but no one even bothered to listen. Guys WAKE UP they’re human beings too. HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SAY THAT!?! IT TAKES SOMEONES DEATH FOR YOU TO TAKE IT SERIOUS!?? Save a life and listen, because that just might be someone you love or maybe even worse..... you. I love kpop and it hurt me that this happened and she even asked for help. What kind of person pushes aside a desperate need of attention to the point where they had to kill themselves?!?? It’s just not right. I love her too....... but the truth is she didn’t make it to heaven. It’s so sad to say but the Bible says that if you destroy your body, it’s destroying GODS creation. It’s not her fault though. She had to go through all these times and she just couldn’t anymore. You know all the people that wished her bad, well you got it, HAPPY NOW!?!? Now live with that guilt, that’s not even half of what you deserve.","[""I think the saddest way to leave Earth is to be killed against your own will. Dying by suicide is probably the second best way to die aside from a natural death, at least I made the decision for myself and went through with it. If you look at Japanese history, suicide was considered an honorable death because it meant you didn't let the enemy take your life.""]",2019-10-15T07:02:11Z,@stobet477
