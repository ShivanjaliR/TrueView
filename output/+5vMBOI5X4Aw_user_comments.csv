12 notes in an octave??,"['Well my friend, an octave has 8 notes. If we start at A: A B C D E F G A (at a higher pitch). But then if we look at the 12-step Western Music scale, an octave can be said to have 12 notes, because you include the semitones: A# C# D# F# G# and we curiously don’t include the higher pitched A in our count (probably because humans like even numbers).\nThis is how the frets of a guitar are laid out. But if you include the microtonal “in between” notes, well you can make however many notes/frets in an octave as you want.\nSo you see, music is relative, and Joey realizes that the only thing that really matters is the ability to melt your face with his guitar playing while wearing blue crocs.\nHave a good day!']",2024-10-31T03:23:15Z,@j49683
