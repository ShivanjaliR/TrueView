"No one is going to vote for Freeland she acts like she's on crack 24/7 lol. The Liberals don't even want Trudeau and got together to try and get him out.. He didn't leave. Trudeau also has so much shit against him. He spent $220,000 on airplane food. He funnels money to him friends and family and has had several conflicts of interest and ethics committee issues that we're just ignoring apparently like the 9mil New York apartment for his buddy, the We charity where he gave them 400mil to go around and buy real estate or how he pushed out the attorney general because she thought he was doing sketchy shit. Or my favourite.. How arrivescam cost around $54 MILLION!! when it should've cost about $80,000. People need to do some research on who they're voting for.",[],2024-11-09T20:28:12Z,@kimberlywoodford
"Right wing left wing…same broken bird. When the wings flap out of synch and only function to keep their own wing flapping through polarization and trying to beat the other wing, a unified nation cannot exist. Politics in general needs a massive overhaul which includes a large reform in partisanship. I am more confident in elementary school children to in general do more good for the public than I am politicians. Luckily for us, massive global institutional change is here.

"Trudeau HAS NEVER won the popular vote  he insured the minority / liberal voters are in key places .  In 2015 trudeau announced the greatest threat to Canada is the whites , christians , anglos and the old stock Canadians  he had plans to replace with migrants through the pact he and freeland signed with a NAZI collaborator later he was imposing UN inspired gun laws ,trudeau announced he was passing laws to make his government and future governments  legally accountable to the UN , before the pandemic he arranged for chinese scientists to leave the country with live ebola viruses  then GAVE himself POGG powers that allowed him to override the constitution and parliament vote process , during the pandemic he announced he was turning Canadas future over to the UN and their approved NGO'S to handle our environment , economy and our immigration .

"Because we follow the US. About 10-15 years behind. Which is *fucking concerning*. Its no accident that Ive noted more racist and hateful rhetoric amongst my peers again, something that most had left behind 10-15 years ago. I've had to start slapping people (or decking them as appropriate) for speaking such filth. You can say it. But stupid should hurt. Being a bigot should hurt. I am merely the delivery vehicle of that lesson. You'll either learn from it or get the fuck out of my life, that choice is yours. 

Needed to do that to a lot of my peers growing up. Thankfully most of them it seems to have stuck. But a few have started to regress, and most have since cut me off, since my response immediately is a swift fucking backhand and the reminder ""talk shit, get hit."" That being said Pierre here has not struck me as the same as other con leaders in the past, whom struck me immediately as basically ""Your all raging pricks and I'd likely have gotten tired in my elbow and shoulder from growing up with you with the amount of smacking you for dumb, distasteful, evil and plain horrible stuff you would say."" 

Pierre here has not given me quite those vibes. Theres been one or two times where I've heard stuff he's said and that reaction of *yeah that should earn a fucking smack* kicks in. But compared to predecessors its surprisingly low. So I'm at least intrigued. I'm jaded about politicians, I'm of the opinion they are all criminals. Pierre is too. They are all crooked as shit I don't care, they are, they all are. No one can have that kind of power and money moving around them and not be. So its more a question of ""Is he too crooked and to much of a shit head? Do I think he should just take a long walk off a short pier?"" Thus far for Pierre my answer is no, so he has my attention at least. Not a vote, I don't commit to voting for a person or a party. Once I got a full spectrum of what the policy goals and missions are for all involved then I'll make a decision based off that for my local representative, I couldn't care less about which party 'wins' prime minister. That isn't how our government is supposed to function. So I don't care about that shit. I don't care what team your on, I care what your policy plans and goals are and do I think they are in the community/country's best interests and will help us the most out of the options on the table. This is why I still vote even though I don't like or trust a single person in politics period. None of them.",[],2024-11-07T02:51:01Z,@Keon753
"The only thing that can save the Liberal Party is if they completely turn out the housing issues.
Not just make it a little better. Completely turn it around.
Also Marriage Equality is a fundamental right enshrined in our Canadian Charter, why are politicians still running on it? Leave it alone and move on, can we concentrate on things that are more important and actually matter? Gay people getting married isn't hurting anyone but the feelings of Religious people, and I'm kind of OK with that. Canada isn't a place for anyone that believes they deserve more freedom or rights than other people, that's what the United States is for.

Sadly, he's the only one who doesn't know this along with his small circle of ass-kissers.  Don't get me started on the scandals either.

They are rejecting the first tier and not including it. The first tier was not ready either - therefore the war against both tiers.

I recommend Ken Wilber that has created the Integral knowledge. He is returning to talk in public after 10 years in recovery.

"I hate how people blame trudeau for shit that is genuinely not trudeau's fault. Now before you skin me alive or cheer for me. I don't like the guy. I hate how he fucked around and failed to bring us election reform. It was the primary reason I voted for him, and I'm genuinely suprised it never seems to be on people's mind. When I explain the concept to everyone, they almost all agree that reform would be a good idea, with just a few people simply not trusting politicians to not reform it for their own benefit. Yet, no one seems to care that it wasn't implemented. 

Fucking christ, y'all hate Trudeau for shit Doug Ford did to you. Seriously, you need to research into the policies that lead to how fucking exepensive everything in this province is. Y'all call trudeau a tyrant when he tries to give money directly to cities to assist with the housing crisis, yet expect him to solve problem he's only capable of tackling but moving past the provincial government. 
You have ford specifically getting in the way of improving our lives because this basterd knows y'all will blame trudeau. 

Hate trudeau all you want, ill be there right next to you. But pay more attention to your provincial governments, and even local governments. You'd be blown away by the amount of control these closer forms of government have on the cost of living and your day to day quality of life.

"$60 dollar carbon tax increase,housing shortage, Trudeau has had 3 controversies, and liberals will lose in next year’s election. I’m voting for Pierre Poilievre over Trudeau and Singh. I feel that Trudeau and Biden forced people to get vaccinated, some people got sick after the vaccine, some people were discriminated from work and public places for not getting vaccinated, vaccines got unnecessarily pushed into politics, there was no need for an obligation or mandate as it should be your body your choice, people didn’t died that didn’t receive the vaccine or booster shot(I got two shots because of my choice of wanting to hangout again with my worker at the time. They wanted all of their clients to be vaccined as well as staff because the government told so other words forced us into obligation and mandates), people include me were labelled anti-bac for being anti-mandate, and people on the left will get pretty aggressive or passive-aggressive if you have an opinion against the Covid mandates and Trudeau’s reaction and response to the freedom convoy. One which was not justified,didn’t give police/RMCP mkre or less power, there were no needs to freeze people’s bank accounts or arrest people besides noise complaints and blockades that putt some people’S lives at risk. The entire freedom convoy was totally avoidable if Trudeau allowed choice over verbal force than physical force. Trudeau forced people(obligated people) to get vaccinated. I have a couple women thst identify as liberals defend Yrudeau and speak out their opinions. Yet they were not respectful after O said twice let’s agree to disagree and if you can’t agree to disagree then there’s a problem. They continued to verbalized their opinion. I followed with please don’t fucking comment back. They did I deleted both messages. I learned never verbalized you political thoughts on Yiktok as people will come at and target you for a literal opinion loke how pathetic! I said ‘the mandates were innecesssty. This doesn’t do with the venerable’ and ‘you got vsccinsted because you work with the venerable thst’S your decision. Yet of if I didn’t want it or I want to is up to me. As same as everyone’.

"Only after the consequences of Trudeau's policies (e.g. the carbon tax, mass immigration) began to hit home to ordinary Canadians did Trudeau's support begin to decline. (He was never popular in Saskatchewan or Alberta outside of Edmonton). The #1 policy of the Canadian Left (most Canadians are Left-wing) is mass immigration, particularly from the Third World. Canada on a per capita basis brings in more people (immigrants, students, refugee claimants, etc.) than any other country in the world. In 2023 alone, Canada brought in 437,000 immigrants, ,604,000 ""temporary"" workers, 1,040,985 students, and, 371,355 ""refugees"", for a total of 2,458,340 people. This has all been done IN ONE YEAR ALONE. Canada neither has the housing nor the doctors or hospitals to deal with all these new people. It should have been obvious to anyone that mass immigration was going to lead to housing shortages and much higher housing costs. However, since Canadians seem eager to prove that they are the world's stupidest voters, and have made Trudeau Prime Minister in three consecutive federal elections, they seem to think that ""increasing public sector"" by 40% will fix the problem. Perhaps Canadians are starting to figure out that such a policy as this is not the path economic prosperity.",[],2024-09-08T20:08:31Z,@thomasjefferson6

Why is he unpopular? This video barely scratches the surface. I thought about it and came up with the following: 

1. Scandals/ethics - SNP, WE, Aga Khan
2. Immigration Mismanagement
3. Fiscal management - cost of living increase, ArriveCan, failed pipelines, CRB claw backs, said he would balance budget in 5y and it has grown
4. Broken Promises - election reform, clean drinking water for natives 
5. Conduct - never answers questions in Commons
6. Embarrassments - Nazi in Commons, Black Face Halloween,  Indian Foreign Trip 
7. International relations - criticized for temporary workers by UN, and NATO for lack of investment 

I'm sure there's more. But I cannot think of a person who has squandered more goodwill.","['Nice summary.  Better than his above, and probably better than our journalists are doing.  And certainly fairer than Poilievre\'s account.  All I would add is ""affordability,"" which is a huge category and difficult to pin on Trudeau in particular.  We need a different model for rental housing and probably for food security.  Basically, guaranteeing housing as a human right while in the case of the second, probably introducing something like food stamps.  If Rental Housing was non-profit and designed to help people build up resources to eventually own something, then this would be much better.  There used to be council housing in the UK -- relatives of mine in the UK have praised it -- this made rental housing more affordable and not open to speculation/redevelopment.

"Trudeau is unpopular for the same reasons that any leader is unpopular: 
1. Print money because he wants to make projects and such that did not help the economy grow, but he still overspent well above the country's monthly and yearly income. When you spend more than you make, that is debt, and country sized debts are turned into generational debt and taxation (AKA INFLATION).
2. Bring in massive amounts of immigrants, legally, illegally, asylum seekers, refugees - immigration was never a political problem in Canada and he made it one - without building the necessary housing, infrastructure, and services to allow the influx to settle in correctly and integrate nicely. Now we have middle eastern and Indian Sub-Continent gangs roaming the entire country, let alone the sky-high rents and pricing out the low/middle income citizens that cannot afford to buy a simple apartment or house.
3. Give massive amounts of taxpayer money to arms' length friends/ministers/family members/companies to expand their businesses/organizations without much oversight or understanding.
4. Freeze the bank accounts of people who disagreed with his health scare during the Covid 19 Pandemic.
5. Continues to deprive the Canadian military of the necessary funding they need to update all the 1960's-1980's equipment.
6. Having 64% of the entire federal politicians be directly or indirectly involved in the housing market, knowingly exacerbating the housing crisis in the country for personal, and familial, and corporate, financial reasons.
7. Forcing the federal elections to be postponed by a week or so, just so a huge majority of Liberal and NDP politicians get a lifetime pension that kicks in the moment they are approved - October 21st, 2025, during that entire week. This is ultra disgusting because it is literally taking taxpayer dollars and giving them for free to politicians with good and well paying jobs and benefits, while every other Canadian needs to pay a tiny bit more in taxes for their politicians' pension plan. I would love to also get a $40,000-$60,000 free of tax income, it would definitely help pay all the student loans and the stupid price of living inflationary pressures they created.",[],2024-09-04T17:21:50Z,@elviselcapo

"Just the Trudeau Liberal carbon tax is enough for Canadians to dump the Liberal party and their green agenda. The Carbon tax was introduced in 2015 at $20 per ton of GHG emissions. Now at $80 per ton, the Liberals want the carbon tax to rise to $170 per ton by 2030! Canada is responsible for around 1.5% of world GHG emissions. Canada has one of the greenest electrical power grids in the world. Let's look at some other countries' emissions and carbon taxes.
-China is responsible for 29.16% of world GHG emissions, and a carbon tax of $10 per ton of GHG emissions.
-The USA is responsible for 14.02% of world GHG emissions, the USA has no national carbon tax, and only 8 US States have a carbon pricing scheme.
-India contributes 7.09 % of world emissions, carbon tax $2. per ton of GHG emissions.
-Russia contributes 4.65% of world GHG emissions carbon tax 0.
So according to the Trudeau Liberals Canadians need to have one of the world's highest carbon taxes when Canada is actually a minor GHG emitter? Canada is also a cold climate country. So Canadians must heat their homes. Canadians commute a lot and as Canada is a huge geographical size tend to drive long distances. Transport trucks must move goods long distances. Why would any government want to impose a huge new tax burden on Canadians? 
-The Trudeau Liberals have mandated only new EVs will be sold in Canada by 2035. The average cost of an EV in Canada is $70,000. The average median income in Canada is $64,000 before taxes. Canadians can't afford even a $40,000 EV. EVs lose a huge amount of range in cold weather, try getting anyone to fix them when they break. Canada is a cold climate country. All the Trudeau Liberals talk about is climate change and climate crisis. I have lived in Canada all my life and the air quality is just fine. That is what Canada is known for clean air and clean water. Massive forests, grasslands, multitude of lakes and rivers. Beautiful seaside areas.

"""Why is Trudeau So Unpopular In Canada?""  The answer is that people in this country are short-sighted and don't understand what's going on in the rest of the world. Look at the rest of the world and see why so many people will give up most anything to be able to move and live here. The Liberal Party is the one that looks after the people.  The PC are only concerned about big business.  If you think you've got woes now, just see what happens if PeePee gets elected.  Programs slashed, everything that is owned by the people is fodder to be sold to balance a budget... in the end, the people lose on every front.  Even members of Pierre's own party have left and consider him a disaster. Most politicians have an absolute maximum 9 year run.  Trudeau is coming to 10.  There is a reason why he got this far, even though the right has called him down for every little thing (and many that were of no fault of his government).  He's a good leader.

"You forgot two scandals:
1. the attestation scandal - Trudeau once said that the biggest threat to Canada was evangelicals, because of a fear that Canadian evangelicals would become like American evangelicals.  Although it isn't entirely untrue that Canadian evangelicals are sometimes influenced by beliefs south of the border, his statement shows a lack of understanding about the differences between those in the the two countries; to the point that many Canadian wings of eva. denoms. are pulling out of cooperation with American former partners.  
Because of this lack of understanding, Trudeau and his party decided to start doing something to push back against evangelical groups getting taxpayer money.  Their answer: require every organization that applied for grants to pay for summer students to sign an attestation stating that they agreed to the Liberal government's stance on abortion and LGBTQ+ issues.  No signature, no grant.  Some organizations tried a third way, saying they supported the separation of church and state and the government's right to have a different moral stance than those of faith but that they could not in good conscience sign an attestation that went against the dictates of their faith.  Those applications were also denied. 
Now, apart from the obvious problem of the Liberals forgetting that the separation of church and state is a two way street, there is something even bigger they somehow missed: conservative evangelicals aren't the only group that differs with the Liberals on their view of one or both of these two issues.  Not only do other Christian groups, like many mainline Protestants and most Catholics, but also many from the Hindu, Sikh, Orthodox Jew, and Muslim faiths as well as many large religious movements like the JWs.  This is a HUGE problem since the Liberals had always campaigned on a platform of being the party that supported immigrant population, and here they were putting out an attestation that would cut back funding for many people of faith in immigrant communities!  Atheist and agnostic political pundits were publicly blasting Trudeaus government for going against the 'Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms' by stepping on people's rights to freedom of religious expression.  Yeah, it didn't go over well and that program was ended after only one year.
2. the trip to India: As previously stated, Trudeau liked to show himself as friend to the immigrant population.  And nothing says, ""I respect your culture"" like going to another country and acting like your playing dress-up the entire time... right...?  On comment that was made about Trudeau and his then wife's attire during their trip was ""they do know we don't dress like they do in Bollywood movies every day...right?""  I know a blue-collar worker that was sent on a friendship trip by a charitable organization to India just a couple of years prior and he was clearly told that the appropriate dress for a man trying to be respectful of Indian culture was black dress pants, white shirt over a white under shirt and black tie.  If an average Canadian was advised that way, how did the PM of Canada miss that memo.  But much more problematic is what happened later in the visit.  Jaspal Atwal — a former member of a Sikh extremist organization banned as a terrorist group and convicted in 1986 of the attempted assassination of an Indian state cabinet minister who was visiting Vancouver Island -  was photographed posing with Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at a private event in Mumbai, as well as Canadian cabinet ministers and MPs.  That did NOT go over well.  


What bothers me as a Canadian, is that both those outside and inside the country act like there are only two parties that can form the government.  We have other options and since Canadian have so often been, ahem, ""messed over"" by the top two parties, it seems like well past time that we give one of the other parties a chance.  They may not do better, but it's unlikely they could do much worse!",[],2024-08-28T23:59:29Z,@macdri

"Having a Trudeau II was always the fraud against democracy required by the PMC flunkies in order to reaffirm a sacred Canadian belief that they are a progressive ""liberal"" people. Especially after the good Christian veneer began to wear thin on the BushyMcTrumpian figure of Steven Harper.
Like in most western democracies it has become  common sense to believe that A) the Right is good at running a national economy, while the left is bad, and B) that liberal is, to all intents and purposes, the left, or at least left enough on the scale of economic competence.
Then, as in the case of others like the UK, the economy trashing of the neoliberal uni-party can continue. And while the plebs busy themselves with whether they are nice enough, or too nice, the Oligarchy (and yes Canada is an Oligarchy), and their flunky PMC somehow end up with the spoils. There is no incompetence here, there should be a new word for what is being done. I propose ""Disscompetence"" - successfully achieving a desired outcome while claiming to have wished the exact opposite and appearing to have f'ed up big time. 
What better a marionette to have performed this sleight of hand than the purely manufactured entity Trudeau the second, complete with a poison dwaf as side kick.

"Your description of the entire Liberal party in Canada was more than kind. Trudeau is widely hated 73% want him to resign, 77% will not vote for him. 
Most Canadians see that the housing and cost of living crisis is a direct result of Trudeau's policies, mass immigration, high spending, high borrowing, high taxation. The liberals have infringed on our Charter rights, that is not speculation but decided in federal court. Crime rates are high, violent crime and auto theft through the roof, the bail system is even letting those who commit murder be granted bail. Identity politics are a major problem as well, as well as policies on social issues especially trans rights and parental rights where the liberals are on the wrong side of 85% of Canadians.
Finally Freeland is almost as hated as Trudeau, she is seen as just as corrupt, incompetent, and lacking morals and integrity as Trudeau. Trudeau has also cause true demise of his party by pushing out the most respected and competent members of his cabinet and possible leadership rivals. The simple fact is Justin Trudeau is the most socialist PM Canada has ever had both he and his party have moved their politics and policies further left than our traditional social party the New Democrats. After a full year of double digit lead and when all factors are considered there is NO path to victory for the Liberals and Trudeau. They are well behind the Conservatives in all 10 provinces, they are behind with men, women, all age groups and in more than half of those demographics they are in third place in popularity. Justin Trudeau leads what has been the most successful political party in the entire commonwealth for over 150 years. It will be destroyed in the next election and will take 12-16 years to rebuild if they ever do.",[],2024-08-21T15:22:46Z,@Jawbone101

NZ) for the knock-on effects from the COVID circumstances, regardless that the government of the time saw the country through the crisis while having comparably excellent health outcomes (go compare COVID stats: USA vs Canada).  5) voting in a more right conservative, ""tax-less"", ""fewer social supports"", ""smaller gov't"" party in Canada will absolutely make the housing shortage (and by extension: affordability problem) much worse which, by extension, will result in greater social problems (homelessness, addiction) also much worse.",[],2024-08-17T19:23:23Z,@neildrd

I would strongly disagree that the Conservatives are popular because of Pierre Polievre. The man is a stuffed suit whose only job has been a political hack with the charisma of a Pit bull. In hockey, he's the guy that goes out and chips at the other teams' star player until the enforcers take care of him.

Social media happens to be one of the most influential means of popular opinion, and, judging from what happened in the US 2016 election it is clear that the more bizarre and conspiratorial the posted material the more likely viewers will be drawn to it. Trudeau is controversial not because of his policies and scandals, but because Poilievre and his handlers are as ruthless, web-savvy, and creative as Trump's handlers.","[""Canada's economic situation has finally encouraged the Bank of Canada to begin lowering interest rates in June of this year, from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.0% in July 2023. The last two years have been difficult on Canadians economically, as they have been in most countries as they gradually recovered from the pandemic, but thanks to increased business investment and a healthy job market we are heading in the right direction."", ""The Carbon Tax was first proposed by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper as an effective way to encourage Canadians and Canadian businesses to adopt more carbon-neutral habits and policies. The Conservatives at the time denied the existence of climate change (they are major backers of Canada's still-booming oil industry) but had to come up with a campaign promise that would also appeal to Canadians who paid attention to global concerns. The Carbon Tax 'has' been effective and would be far more so if it weren't for such a powerful and money-hungry oil and gas industry. An industry that is heavily responsible for Canada consistently making the worst-15 list of GHG emitters per capita in the world!\n\nThe first to legislate a Carbon Tax was the BC Liberals (now known as BC First), who were no more Liberals than the Harper Conservatives were, in 2008 thus avoiding a federally-regulated plan. The federal Carbon Tax wasn't legislated until 2019 after Trudeau had been in office for four years. As the Carbon Tax is intended to target the biggest emitters of CO2 about 80% of Canadian citizens receive a rebate, which usually exceeds what they have paid in fuel for heating and travel, four times per year in provinces where the federal government manages the program. The other provinces, BC and Quebec, as well as the three territories manage their own Carbon Tax and provide rebates similar to the federal program. The only reason the Carbon Tax is controversial is because of rabble rousing on social media by Pierre Poilievre and his ill-informed followers."", ""Canada's housing situation is dire, but Trudeau carries only a small portion of the blame. The real problem started in 1994 with Mulroney's Conservative government. Brian Mulroney was a staunch Neoliberal who focused heavily on privatization, unregulated open economies, globalization, and a hands-off approach when it came to government regulation and social spending - including affordable housing. The Conservatives, and the following Liberal government under Jean Chretien, had large deficits and so cut funding for social programs and services to try and get a handle on their wanton neoliberal fiscal management. One major elimination under Mulroney was the CMHC (the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) which provided communities all across Canada with funding to build affordable housing. Although the federal government (now) provides funding for housing it is essentially up to the provinces to ensure housing starts keeps up with need."", ""When scandals erupt around government, which is inevitable no matter what party is in power, the public is rarely privy to all the details. The SNC Lavalin affair is a perfect example. What was not mentioned in the news was the fact that SNC Lavalin threatened the government, that should the corporation face charges for the Libyan bribery schemes they would move their head office from Quebec to Europe. Thousands of Canadian jobs would have been lost, but that wasn't even the biggest problem. Quebec's pension fund manager, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, had a 20% stake in SNC Lavalin. There was no doubt that the federal government was between a rock and a hard place over what would happen to the pension fund if the engineering corporation followed through with its threat and moved it's head operations. We must also ask what role Frank Iacobucci, one of Stephen Harper's confidantes, played in the whole fiasco.""]",2024-08-11T16:08:21Z,@karennyland1814

Our companies have lobbied politicians into becoming LEGALLY ENFORCED MONOPOLIES.
Were a clown economy, and its a surprise that we even have a GDP.
Lets also not forget how in 2015, we had a housing crisis on the level of America in 2024, yet we didn't do ANYTHING about it.
We also imported a shit ton of immigrants, but the regulations/taxes make it impossible for companies to expand to properly take advantage of this new work force.

While Canada was stagnating, we sent $5 billion to the Philippines to fight climate change, and spent billions on other stupid shit.
Lets also not forget how we have one of the BEST firearm licensing systems in the world, that ensures firearms stay away from criminals. 
But because of Trudeau's ineptitude with the US border flooding our country with illegal firearms, Canadian gun owners had to suffer Trudeau's emotional response.

as for trudeau, he only became leader of the liberal party because of his family name and his father's legacy as prime minister. justin has never held a full-time job in his life (becoming an member of parliament was his first full-time job) and has lived off his family's trust fund his entire life. he has never had to struggle for anything in his life and has zero connection or understanding of working class and middle class canadians. the liberal party touts itself as the ""governing party of canada"" and will reach for every measure to gain power, even cynically appointing justin as leader of the party. 

canada's antiquated first past the post electoral system is a farce which allows any party of winning a majority government with around 35% of the popular vote. what this incentivizes is parties chasing seats in heavily populated eastern regions (toronto and surrounding cities in the gta and golden horseshoe, ottawa, and montreal), and areas of the country that rely on government subsidies and welfare (atlantic provinces), and assuaging the separatist tendencies of french voters in quebec.

back to trudeau, he meets many of the criteria of narcissism, is woefully illiterate with respect to economics, finance, and budgets, and is a spineless maleable blob that is easily formed by laurentian elite power brokers within the party. i find him to be a woefully unintelligent speaker, someone who is incurious, and someone who believes in nothing he is saying. many of his speeches and media answers are word salads, lacking in any intellectual and policy heft.",[],2024-07-23T15:58:58Z,@lesktube

It really doesn't matter who gets power, because only one of two parties has a chance in hell of winning, and both parties have already sold out public interests decades ago.

"The Carbon Tax attacks pretty much everyone outside the big cities; it makes you a ""bad person"" if you are using carbon based fuels; drivers, farmers, rural dwellers -- screwed.

Massive immigration is indeed the root cause of house inflation; demand exceeds supply, so prices jumped as far as the low interest loans would allow.

Invoking the Emergency Act, where a simply Ottawa police action was needed, was an immense authoritarian overstep; it will not soon be forgotten. Trudeau's crushing abuse and dismissal of personal freedoms during Covid will haunt Canadians forever.

Backing out of the commitment to proportional representation is clearly meant to avoid dilution of power to smaller parties; this is a cynical response that insulted Liberal's base.

The Lavalin affair exposed the craven influence of money on Trudeau and politics. Two ministers that stood on the high ground were removed by Trudeau. It doesn't get any lower.

Enrichment of his family through ""WE"" was absolutely disgusting. It's also hard to imagine a politician allowing such a stupid scheme.

The truth is that the govt will NEVER have enough of your money, bc they consistently mismanage it and too much gets caught up in red tape and bureaucracy to be effective anyway. Government is made to be an inefficient system, and they do not manage the money well bc they did not earn it themselves, so it is not a priority.

the price of living has literally 4xed in the past couple of years while the minimum wage has went up somewhere around 20% [vs the 400% increase in prices] and that's just recent. plus, everything [especially groceries] has gotten smaller and worse quality here. meaning the actual value of the dollar has worsened even further. in the past like 10 years, the average cost of living has went up by somewhere around 1500% whereas the wage has went up ~60%. there's also less jobs, less housing, more drug use than ever before, more homelessness than seen before - if you look into it fully and only read real, factual data and not just bs spewed out by liberals with no source - you'd find that the situation we're in today is possibly WORSE than the great depression. yet they're acting as if everythings fine.

Canadian's are tired of being taxed more and more, tired of our systems becoming more and more inefficient. The benefit doesn't match the cost. 

This isn't that we don't value our institutions, its that reform is needed, they aren't working as they should. 

Have this occurring under a PM and party which has scandal after scandal, without repercussion, and you end up with a populace which is disinterested in what the LPC has to offer. CPC is at least different enough, and at least not dismissing the concerns of the citizens, to garner votes.

More succinctly, the LPC lost the centre, and the CPC is picking it up. This yields the appearance of swinging right, but its instead the shift of the  Overton Window and the CPC making themselves available to the centre.

"One thing that was left out was the socio-political issues that Trudeau has gotten himself into the middle of... He's been widely criticized for ignoring Indigenous Canadian concerns, only to come back years later with dumping a ''truck load'' of money with no structure or plans - both of these approaches were criticized Canadians.  Then there's the free-speech, religious rights, and parental rights controversies that have haunted Trudeau.  

   He could (and SHOULD) have approached these issues with caution, but did he?  Nope.  He didn't want to backdown from being known as the ''ideologically progressive'' PM so even when he was CLEARLY taking advice only from special interest advocacy groups, he created laws limiting freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and parental rights & protections to determine how children are influenced.  The most infamous of all being Bill C-16 which has already been abused to pursue legal action against everyday citizens for not using self-identified expressions of gender or sex.  

   Bill C-18 was also very controversial in how it meddled with what online content Canadians were allowed to see and/or produce.  Internationally it didn't sit well with most Canadians that our beloved (and seemingly out of touch) leader INTENTIONALLY broke the Paris Climate Accord AND our 2% GDP spending requirement for NATO.

"I've talked to a bunch of people who really hate Trudeau, so I'll list off a few reasons why people complain. One reason a lot of people don't like Trudeau is his persistent need to tax not the ultra wealthy, but the mildly well off, hitting farmers with the carbon tax when most of them are producing food in one way or another seems batshit when almost all of the carbon is being produced by industrial manufacture, one way or another, and farmers do not make a great deal of profit per year, their real gains are in equity over time in most cases. Farmers should have instead been rewarded for making green choices, rather than being punished for just doing business. Now I guess they're adjusting capital gains to start pinching people at relatively low wealth levels, again missing the whole point of 'eat the rich' because 'the rich' are his personal friends and allies. That brings me to another reason he's not very popular, because Trudeau can be pretty smarmy, and is very ensconced with the wealthy elites. People know who he's personal friends with, and most of us wouldn't be willing to piss on those people if they were on fire. I think the final (and easily the biggest) reason is that Trudeau supports LGBTQ rights somewhat vocally, while Polly will definitely not, regardless of what he says (I'd be happy to be wrong, but I can see what similar conservatives do elsewhere in Canada if given a majority), and a LOT of people still hate the LGBTQ movement, and find public Pride displays to be salt in the still raw wound of merely having to tolerate these superficially different human beings. I personally don't particularly like Trudeau (and wonder if he should step down before the next election and give someone else a proper go, rather than drag the party down with him), but I don't think he was as bad for Canada as harper was in a plurality of ways. Why is it the Conservatives can't run another Joe Clark type?? While I didn't think mittens with the string through the sleeves were cool as a kid, I now understand and kinda wish I had something like that, so I think everyone's biggest complaint about his type is now done, why do we have to run creepy looking guy who's so far right? Canadians don't want far right, and they've been clear about that, but the problem here is the party is run by the far right and it's money, so they keep choosing candidates that are incredibly far right and losing to centrist Trudeau. Run a center right smart guy who's nerdy enough to wear his mittens on a string through his sleeves during the winter, I want to see sensible footwear and comfortable and decently cut (if not exactly stylish) suits, not more far right guys who look like they were adopted as a child by a far right Think Tank and raised on a steady diet of propaganda.",[],2024-07-08T12:06:14Z,@mightyone3737

To summarize, he's not for the people, he's for the wealth, and he's slowly becoming more and more of a dictator.","[""- Nobody has provided evidence to support the claim that Trudeau had cocaine on his private jet; this rumour originates from a claim from India's ambassador to Sudan.\n\n- The Toronto rain tax is a proposal, not a policy that is currently active, and the municipal tax isn't even the federal government's jurisdiction. Also, if you've seen the flooding in Toronto this past week, you would've wished we had a rain tax to alleviate some of the flooding (which will likely become a once-in-a-decade occurrence or even more often)""]",2024-07-08T03:07:31Z,@koolaid33

"That's Tredeau's biggest failure IMO, not that he necessarily caused a lot of the problems Canada is facing, though he did cause some of them, it's that in his entire time in office he fixed none of them. Pretty much all of his ""fixes,"" have been band aids, not even addressing the issue. Price of groceries too high - rebate. Rent too high - paying rent increases your credit score. Inflation too high - increase interest rates. Housing costs too high - Promise you'll build a bunch of homes but do nothing. Over immigration fueling pretty much all of these issues - gaslight everyone by calling them racist and then finally admit that it's an issue years later. And so on.

I'm not sure how much of this is his failure or the failure of the governmental system as a whole, because getting things done in the Canadian government is extremely challenging if everyone doesn't agree on something, which of course your political opponents typically wont, especially if doing so makes you look bad.

1. Historically high overspending, racking up deficits and devaluing the Canadian dollar, and the reason for high food and housing inflation and now interest rates
2. Tripling or Quadrupling annual immigrant numbers from 300-400k to 1-1.2 million post COVID without factoring in housing, hospital, education shortages/resources
3. Shutting down absolute discourse from conservative and fringe groups that criticize his governance, arresting them without due process
4. Championing far left woke ideals
5. Failing to listen to provincial and municipal levels of government, particularly when they cannot absorb the high immigrant targets
6. Shutting down western Canadian oil contracts/industry and making it harder for farmers to afford the costs of farming
7. Introducing new taxes and increasing others such as the carbon and capital gains taxes

"The Conservative Party offers the same non-solution they always have for the same issues they’ve attacked Trudeau for and aim to ruin the country in many other ways too. They have never been able to solve the housing crisis nor have they actually implemented any policy to successfully tackled the rising cost of living. Trudeau needs to go but the conservatives will continue to do nothing when they are elected and more people will be harmed because their plans and policies don’t actually address Canadian issues. Balancing the budget always means taking money away from health care and education. Then conservatives complain about health care and offer to privatize it, which would result in way worse living conditions for most Canadians. Like imagine complaining about the public health system but continuously lowering funding and money from the government to support it. It’s to improve their own purpose of privatizing health care in Canada. All the while simultaneously failing to tackle housing issues. Canadians need better education, health care, and more taxes on corporations that price gouge food and landlords that charge ridiculous rent for little to no space (e.g., $2550 a month for 300 square foot apartment). Increase taxes on people with unoccupied properties that they own and reinvest the money into building more affordable properties.",[],2024-07-05T16:38:39Z,@brownee19

"For all the comments about how the housing situation is a Trudeau problem: please please look more into the matter. It's a highly provincial/municipal issue (among other things). It's a complicated problem. If you are dying to own a home, you too would also advocate for things for your neighborhood that would not increase housing availability because they hinder the traffic around you, it affects your equity, your taxes, or safety of the neighborhood etc. There is affordable housing being built near my home. Do I/my neighbors want this there? No! Is it something that is aimed to help the housing/rental problem? Yes. Now dial those kind of ideas up to a governmental scale and you can easily surmise that housing is complicated and certain parts of government make it difficult. It certainly wont be corrected by PP; he probably has zero interest in fixing it when incumbent. Trudeah or PP, neither can fix it in their terms.

"Despite being a Canadian who never voted for Trudeau, doesn't particularly like him, and won't vote liberal in the next election: the idea of a Poilievre majority terrifies me (especially with the thought of a potentional Trump government to our South). The part the concerns me the most is how uneducated the people I know who blindly support him are on world events, economics and even (what I consider) should know info like who his donors are. The things that scares me about Poilievre is his:
- I look at what policies the new Conservative provincial governments have enacted as a road map for what a Conservative federal government might do. Alberta has attacked transgendered people and put additional taxes on electric cars that gas cars don't pay. Shouldn't we be encouraging the change to electric vehicles for the good of the planet and not taxing it!?? Nova Scotia: Changed the qualifications of the Unaffordable Housing poverty measure from spending 30% of post-tax income on housing to *50% of pre-tax income* as well as only allowing people with official leases to qualify (so people like the single mothers renting a closet under the stairs no longer qualify). For example earning $2000 a month allowed a tax break if you spent more than ~$350/month of housing. Now, you'd need to pay more than $1000/month of housing on that same income to qualify. I wonder why Nova Scotia has seen Canada's largest growth in homelessness? That scares me because Poilievre, despite using the term ""affordable housing"" more than 100 times, still hasn't described what ""affordable housing"" is to him. Also, to me, the provincial Conservative governments tell me what the federal one will do. So seeing the Conservative provincial govs enact policies that dehumanize people, speed up the destruction of our planet and promote fossil fuel usage, and removing roofs from the heads of the most venerable in society, disproportionately effecting women and minorities is disgusting to me.
- Every western nation is experiencing housing and cost of living crisis's. This isn't a Canada only issue: it's a late stage global Capitalism issue. There are many companies with a greater market cap than the GDP of most western countries. We shouldn't be surprised that Smith, receiving donations from oil executives, is taxing electric cars. We shouldn't be surprised that Houstin, receiving donations from REIT executives, has made it harder to put an affordable roof over people's heads. When these same people donate to Poilievre, we shouldn't be surprised if the same thing happens federally.
- Talks on repeat about only 3 issues as if being Prime Minister is that simple: housing affordability, the carbon tax, and cost of living. Even though he's voted against almost every single federal policy that would relieve these issues for Canadians.
- Claims he'll bring affordable housing despite several of his top donors being executives of multi billion dollar trust funds which is a driving cause of why there is no housing in Canada's jacked up for-profit rental market... Not to mention he's a landlord himself, owns 50% of a REIT and over $10 million in unaffordable housing. So I find it hard to imagine he'll enact policies that will cripple his lifetime's investments and those of his donors.

- Willingness to literally point a finger directly at Trudeau and blame him for all of Canada's woes (such as the housing crisis which is largely a municipal and provincial issue, or the carbon tax as if climate change isn't real). I say this because most of the people I've met who will stick a finger in your face and blame you for things are incompetent narcissists. I don't like Trudeau, but watching Poilievre standing in parliament and physically pointing a finger at him and saying, ""You did this"" should be embarrassing for all Canadians to watch.

TLDR: We've never voted for a federal government besides Conservative and Liberal, so if we just continue voting these two parties, we shouldn't be surprised if our suffering continues. Many of the issues we experience today were a problem before Trudeau when the conservatives had a multi term government with a majority.

"The biggest issue with Canadian politics is citizens don't understand (or care to) Canadian politics and the role of each level of government. 

A lot of what Trudeau gets blamed for are issues that aren't even federal issues, they're either provincial and/or local jurisdictions. Most of Canadian provinces are governed by Conservative governments and people fail to even grasp at local government (election turnout of local elections are low, like in the 30 percents)

But the Conservative provincal governments never take responsibility for their actions, and consistently blame the federal government - when in fact its their years of cutbacks to healthcare, education and housing that we're where we are today. You have some provinces that have taken funds for healthcare, but instead of using on healthcare, stashed into general reserves. 

By no means giving Trudeau and/or the Federal Liberals a free-pass, they have done their fair of stupid shit, particularly when it comes to messaging. They do a terrible job at messaging to the public.  Also Justin Trudeau suffers from name and that political dynasty of his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, as politicians of that era where a lot more controversial.","[""yeah healthcare is a huge gripe and that's ford's fault over here in ontario"", ""Doug Ford and other provincial Conservative premiers passed four back to back federal deficit  budgets before the pandemic even hit us?

Trudeau himself spent $55 THOUSAND on food in 2022 alone which is more than the vast majority of Canadians make after taxes.  Due to the horrible economic policies of the federal Liberals (massive debts, printing of currency, massive immigration during a housing crisis) inflation is skyrocketing out of control as housing costs have more than doubled in 9 years, and food prices continue to increase beyond the average Canadian's ability to afford it, this while Liberals make record salaries and spend our money lavishly while telling us to cut our expenses if we are running out of coin...",[],2024-07-04T03:37:03Z,@thisspacenotforrent

"While I do really want a change in leadership (ie. Trudeau getting out of parliament), I have two big concerns with Pierre Pollieve:

1. If his solution to the housing crisis is anything similar to the conservatives in Ontario, he will be taking over prime agricultural land and building big single family homes to sell to all the rich folks at an insane price. He will not consider apartments or townhomes as a viable option because it's ""not what Canadians want.""
In my opinion, what we NEED is affordable, low cost living, so that we can attempt to save enough money to one day buy a house.

2. Again, as shown by our conservative leadership in Ontario, I believe he will bring back lots of fossil fuel energy that we have been working to get rid of, because it will be cheaper. In my mind that is insane.
In order to one day have a sustainable country, we need to push through some uncomfortable years where we invest in transitioning to cleaner energy.

Because Trudeau does not lead and his silence against terrorism in public and not publicly supporting Israel speaks unknown volumes. He has been in office and surrounded by a small bubble. He doesn’t know the average man or woman. I voted for him but I won’t again. He demonstrates weakness when he is our leader. Terrorism is bad. Canada being thanked by Hamas is bad. Your tweets do not make a difference. We need a leader in these times not a mouse. Families are broke. I work in mental health and I have never seen it so bad. People with families breaking down because society is squeezing them financially from everywhere and they’re losing hope and can’t sleep or function well. The people don’t feel he cares about them. Just his inner circle and what looks good but not core issues. Why is re-naming Dundas Square a priority by the way. Millions of dollars for something not essential. What a waste.

"The hilarious part is that people are actually convinced that the conservative party will enact radical change that will positively impact people's lives immediately. While Trudeau is absolutely to blame for the current state of affairs because he ignored the housing crisis for a solid 8 years before even addressing it, neither party has a vested interest in property prices going down. Firstly, homeowners make up a huge voting block, because they are more likely to be older and citizens, meaning they are more likely to vote, and both parties like people funding their spending and retirement through reverse mortgages instead of having to increase pensions. Secondly, basically every politician has a property portfolio, or at least wealthy family with a property portfolio. 

But more importantly, even if the conservative party wanted to cause housing prices to go down the process will almost certainly take years to fix. Sure you can fix structural problems like decreasing zoning regulation (though that's more a provincial and local thing) but the new homes that will enable will still take years to be built. Then you have the problem with high interest rates making construction loans less viable, which has decreased housing starts, but they definitely don't want to lower interest rates because then inflation is a problem again. Decreasing immigration would eventually lower demand, but again that would take a few years, and I honestly can't see the conservative party doing that, not to mention there's a whole other host of problems with the population shrinking. I also can't imagine a conservative government funding public housing. 

The most they'll do is increase Canadian dependence on the oil sands to placate voters in the west, which may increase short-term growth, but doesn't address the fact Canada's economy suffers a lack of diversification. My prediction for the next decade of the conservatives in power is that the oil sector will increase, but very little will change structurally.",[],2024-07-03T01:40:12Z,@XandateOfHeaven

"The Century Initiative[a][2] is a Canadian lobby group and charity that aims to increase Canada's population to 100 million by 2100.[3] This includes increasing the population of megaregions, which are interlocking areas with more than one city centre and a typical population of 5 million or more (e.g., the Greater Toronto Area, Greater Vancouver, and the National Capital Region).[3]

The Century Initiative was co-founded by Mark Wiseman and Dominic Barton, who also led the Advisory Council on Economic Growth under three-term Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.[4][5] The Initiative was supported by former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney[6] before his death, and by influential Liberal Party advisors including advisors to former Minister of Finance Bill Morneau.[7][8] The Century Initiative has been listed on Canada's lobbyist registry since 2021 and has organized meetings with the immigration minister's office, the minister's parliamentary secretary, and Conservative and NDP members of parliament.[9]

Mission
The Century Initiative aims to increase Canada's population to 100 million by 2100;[3] its official mission statement reads:

Growing our population to 100 million by 2100 would reduce the burden on government revenues to fund health care, old age security, and other services.[10][11]

This includes increasing the population of megaregions. It suggests a population increase for the Greater Toronto Area from 8.8 to 33.5 million, the Greater Montreal region from 4.4 to 12.2 million, the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor from 2.8 to 15.5 million, the Greater Vancouver region from 3.3 to 11.9 million, the National Capital Region from 1.4 to 4.8 million, the Southwestern Ontario region from 1.2 to 2 million, and the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region from 800,000 to 1.7 million.[3]

The organization intends to reach its population goal through a massive increase in immigration and by investing in economic development around megaregions.[3][12]

Century Initiative forecasts predict that, without changes to Canadian immigration policy, the population of Canada will increase to 53 million people by the end of the century.[12]",[],2024-07-02T21:17:02Z,@davideriksen2434

"Canadians are lost politically. There's a video on YouTube that addresses the problems with Canada's economy, and when you follow the trail, they all lead back to the Conservatives. In fact, most of the ""good"" decisions that the former Conservative government made were clones of the former Liberal Governments policies. Now Canada edging closer to another election. And yes, Trudeau and Freeland need to go, because Canada needs another Turner, Martin, or Chretien. This Liberal Government has been trying to do too much good with not enough foresight. On the other hand we have Pollivier who has yet to make one solid statement on how he will do anything different (maybe ax the carbon tax), but housing is a Canadian problem, one a government dare not get involved with. One thing Trudeau has hit the nail on is the fact that Canadians homeowners cannot afford to have the price of their  homes fall. Taxing the profit on home sales is one way to slow home prices (but that's another story). As a Canadian, I am okay with most of what the Liberals do (but detest Trudeau). I am not of the so-called middle class, so my life  under the Liberals is better than it was under the Conservatives because the Conservatives have a historical record of serving the highest earning third of Canadians while ignoring the rest. 

But Canadians need to understand something... high food prices? Yes they are higher, but they are also lower than many countries in Europe and even Asia (lived in Thailand for three years during COVID, and my wife and I spend less on monthly groceries here than we did there). High gas prices? We are a long way from 6 euros a litre, and the average Thai makes  less than 25%C a day but pays around 1.30 to 1.50 Canadian a litre. Housing is the killer in Canada, and the problem with housing started in 2009 when the Conservatives decided to stimulate the economy by making houses easier to buy, leading to where Canadians are now, a country whose GDP rests no on the strength of our financial services, not on our manufacturing strength (which the Conservatives gave away with NAFTA), but on our building, buying, and selling homes...",[],2024-07-02T03:06:27Z,@perrybakr4252

"Trudeau has just piled on too much scandal luggage: Aga Khan private island vacation, SNC Lavalin, silly traditional Indian dress photo shoot, WE Charity, Yaroslav Hunka a Nazi in Parliament, the ArriveCan app development with zero cost oversight.  Carbon Tax flip flop, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree; does anyone remember wage and price controls by his father in the 70s? Carbon Tax does little for the environment, it just creates more bureaucracy. No one is going to stop heating their homes or sell their house and move closer to work just because heating fuel and gasoline go up a bit in cost. Everyone just goes on living and behaving the same as they did in the past, with less disposable income. Whereas, Cap and Trade would reduce carbon emissions. CEOs are under continual, daily pressure to improve their company’s profits. If by investing in cleaner and more efficient processes, the company would have carbon credits to sell, the company would make that investment. If you want to let Adam Smith's invisible hand and free enterprise fix climate change, then carbon emissions must have a cost.

There’s also the Black Face thing.  I think it’s time the world put that petty stuff behind us and move on.  If a blonde Caucasian actor in a play was portraying an Asian character in the story, and they put a black wig on the actor, should everyone lose their minds?   Yes, I know about the stupid Jim Crow segregation laws, Amos and Andy, Al Jolson, etc., Confederate KKK stuff from the Southern states, but let’s throw that bit of history into the dust bin – where it belonged in the first place.

I'm neutral on the guy. I've voted for every party at some level of politics over my 15 year voting history and I can see the good and the bad in the guy, but if you want the reasons he's unpopular it's those PLUS the fact that people who are neutral or centrist on the issue have had their social media flooded since 2019 with memes from their right wing friends and hairdressers.",[],2024-07-01T13:43:48Z,@BackWhereYouStarted

"A Prolix Peroration on the Inexorable Declension of Justin Trudeau's Hegemony and the Concomitant Apotheosis of Pierre Poilievre

**I. The Cataclysmic Crepuscule of Justin Trudeau's Reign:**

* **Precipitous Plummeting of Approbation Indices:** In the wake of a near-decennial tenure at the apogee of governance, Trudeau's approval ratings have plummeted to an unprecedented nadir of -32, an unparalleled bathysphere in his political trajectory. His Liberal faction now languishes in a state of abject desuetude, trailing their Conservative adversaries by a Brobdingnagian 20 points, garnering a mere 23% in the court of popular opinion.

* **Pecuniary Perturbations of Brobdingnagian Proportions:** A preponderant factor contributing to Trudeau's waning popularity is the parlous state of the Canadian economic landscape, which has assumed a Kafkaesque quality of surreal dysfunction.

* **Policy Impugnments of Cyclopean Magnitude:** The Conservative Party, under Poilievre's Machiavellian aegis, has launched a fusillade of philippics against Trudeau's policy initiatives, each more scathing than the last.

* **Scandals and Contretemps of Herculean Proportions:** Trudeau's tenure has been besmirched by a litany of scandals so egregious as to make Caligula blush.

* **""Death by a Thousand Cuts"" - A Sisyphean Ordeal:** Trudeau's declining popularity appears to be the cumulative result of myriad grievances, each infinitesimal in isolation, yet collectively amounting to a Gordian knot of political opprobrium.

**II. The Promethean Ascension of Pierre Poilievre:**

* **Capitalizing on Disenchantment with Machiavellian Finesse:** Pierre Poilievre, the newly-anointed Prometheus of the Conservative Party, has adroitly capitalized on the public's disillusionment with Trudeau, wielding their discontent like a thyrsos to rally the masses.

* **Political Positioning of Protean Complexity:** Poilievre navigates a precarious tightrope of such gossamer thinness as to make Blondin's Niagara crossing seem pedestrian by comparison.

* **Foreign Policy of Byzantine Intricacy:** Poilievre has woven a tapestry of foreign policy positions so intricate as to make the Bayeux Tapestry seem a child's scribble.

**III. The Phantasmagorical Future of Canadian Political Landscape:**

* **Trudeau's Sisyphean Task:** With an election looming on the horizon like a Damoclean sword, Trudeau confronts a task so Herculean as to make the Twelve Labors seem a trifling inconvenience.

* **Poilievre's Potential Triumph of Cyclopean Magnitude:** Current prognostications, divined from the entrails of political punditry, suggest a Conservative victory of such overwhelming proportions as to make Ozymandias weep with envy.

**IV. Denouement of Labyrinthine Complexity:**

The Canadian political landscape is undergoing a metamorphosis so profound as to make Kafka's Gregor Samsa seem a paragon of stability. While Trudeau's early tenure was characterized by a popularity that would have made Narcissus blush, a confluence of economic anxieties, perceived policy shortcomings, and scandals of Augean proportions have reduced his political capital to a state of penury. Capitalizing on this miasma of disaffection with Machiavellian adroitness, Pierre Poilievre has positioned himself as the deus ex machina of Canadian conservatism. Barring an intervention by the Fates themselves, Canada appears poised for a changing of the guard so momentous as to make the passing of Arthur's sword to Bedivere seem a mere bagatelle.",[],2024-06-30T13:07:37Z,@nfaza80

"Freeland may be slightly more popular than Trudeau, but not by much. While it's true that she stood rather strong against Trump when that felon tried to bully Canada in the USMCA trade negotiations, she has a very strong association with Trudeau and his policies. 

Poilievre has the benefit of not having been a minister in a previous federal government, but the prospect of him leading the country is genuinely terrifying. He is as detached from reality as Trudeau has become detached from the common man. The NDP is far from being popular enough to do anything substantial, and the other parties don't really have a full enough platform to be serious candidates. Canada is screwed and both of its leading parties need a seismic shift if we want to avoid a ""lost decade"" coming into the 2030s.

The most significant issue for Canada is the housing crisis. It is bad for Canadians, drives down immigration of good talent, and, worse in our context, ties up everyone's money in mortgage or rent, preventing proper portfolio investments into Canadian businesses. This last part essentially causes productivity to stagnate, leading to a reduction in purchasing power. There are two-three main problems to fix, and no one from the federal government seems to do anything about them: there is a scarcity in building materials, driving prices up, there is too much inefficient red tape to get construction going, leading to smaller, delayed, housing projects, thus keeping supply too low for current demand, and zoning in most cities and suburbs is too restrictive, preventing the construction of medium density housing, again keeping supply too low.

There are efforts, mostly in British Colombia and in Montreal, to address the 3rd problem, at least to some extent. But those efforts may not be comprehensive enough to make a significant difference, and the other two issues remain.

Fix those three problems, stimulate portfolio investments into Canadian companies, favour business investments into R&D, and adjust immigration quotas to match housing supply, hopefully increasing them over time as supply increases, and we may make it out of the 2020s on a hopeful and rising trajectory.",[],2024-06-29T16:05:53Z,@Zartren

Including using his power to scheme against his enemies in the press.
He's also shut down businesses and closed bank accounts of any citizen who spoke up against him.
He forced the injections... the untested injections on citizens.
He's introduced racist programs that offer special loans and other advantages to exclusively non-white people.
He's called himself a feminist, but he's been known for grabbing a female reporter's behind.
He's made back door deals with Chinese communists.
He even stoked fears and rage about fake mass graves in Canada.

His claims that the environment is his utmost concern has been a total sham.
He has sold Canada in parts to foreign interests.

There is no actual left to turn to so Canadians now look to the conservatives as the only game in town. They at least talk a good game about undoing the damage. 

The NDP has moved so far away from anything that is centered on working class Canadians, they  have made themselves irrelevant. I know many former NDP supporters who have despise the party now, and will vote conservative in the upcoming election.  

What people of all political stripes should be wondering is - how does a new government simply move into the existing landscape without being coopted and controlled by the very same forces that have so completely captured the liberal party?  

I suspect Canadians will be pretty disappointed in the new Polievre government before too long.  Of course this is simply the history of Canadian politics in general where parties always reveal themselves as just as bad as the last lot by the time they are given the boot.  The corruption has been far worse than most people imagined, but lately it has become so rampant that they are starting to see the true scale of the problem. 

One can only hope that the conservatives will fix some of the more extreme policy disasters that are driving the country into the ground. As long as the corporate mafia types continues to buy politicians, and co-opt the whole government in a myriad of ways, it’s hard to believe the trajectory of events will actually be reversed.

"Everyone is forgetting that our current 'news media' in Canada has shifted the overton window to the right, big time over the last couple of years. 
We have too many American oligarch owned 'news' outlets here in Canada as well.

There is very little left leaning news here. CBC is centrist, The Star leans left. Everything else is wealth class right leaning oriented. There's a handful of smaller left leaning and environmental based news/media outlets but they rarely get mainstream attention.

So much of our 'news' over the last couple years blames Trudeau for faults of Conservative lead Provinces like Ontario and Alberta. These Conservative Premiers basically get away scott-free with their massive regression then make sure the 'news' is their mouthpiece to distract us and blame Trudeau for something he didn't do. Healthcare privatization efforts = Provincial Conservatives, Pro-fossil fuel efforts = Provincial Conservatives, Environmental Deregulation (greenbelt) = Provincial Conservatives.

What Canada needs is a SIGNIFICANT change to our 'news media' and messaging. The overton window has turned significantly right in this Country due to it's extremely right biased 'news' landscape.

I would say that is the largest contributor to Trudeau's bad public image right now.

The Canadian 'news' pushes a wealth-class oriented rage-based agenda aimed to convince us to get angry and support the ass-backwards Conservative Party.

Always pay attention to the framing of our news and the details. Think about why our headlines are so rage-based and full of blanket statements. Think about why that messaging is being pushed that way onto us.

"You didn't mention that there's a rebate to the carbon tax. Everyone pays into it when they buy something based on the amount of pollution its production created, everyone gets the same amount back, if you buy more things that create a lot of pollution than average, you're a net payer, if you don't, you get more money back than it costs you. Because most of the pollution is created by the richest people, the vast majority get more back than they pay. It's kind of ridiculous how dishonest people are about this, I'm not saying TLDR is being dishonest, just ignorant, but Canadians who have had ample opportunity to actually learn about how this will simply lie through their teeth. I believe that they desperately need to blame someone else for their financial woes. The general Canadian lifestyle is unbelievably wasteful and Canadians have essentially locked themselves into the most expensive lifestyle they possibly could. Then the entire world experienced higher prices for many things and this financially irresponsible lifestyle was no longer viable. Of course a lot of people are struggling simply because Canada tried to engineer a housing shortage so many people could profit off of greatly increasing real estate values. Any way you look at it, the federal government is probably the least responsible for any of this on a long list of provincial governments, municipal governments, Putin, and the horribly greedy and consumeristic Canadian lifestyle. It is literally impossible for the federal government to fix the housing shortage when most of the jurisdiction is at the provincial and municipal level and many Canadians don't want it to be fixed because it would cut into their capital gains. Trudeau has become the scapegoat for this and will receive the blame while Canadians keep trying to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor. And no, he should have maintained high immigration levels otherwise there would be too many retirees per taxpayer and boomers didn't pay enough taxes during their lives to actually pay for their retirements and all of the benefits and services they will need.

"So... Trudeau is extremely unpopular, true, but the ""why"" could not fit into a 10-minute video. You gave it a fair shake in a short video, and well done for that. Here's a short list just off the top of my head:

1. The Carbon tax is one issue, one tax. The Liberal government has imposed several new taxes: ""Netflix"" tax, raising capital gains tax, a leaving the country tax, vacant residence tax, and yes, two carbon taxes. 
2. The next issue is inflation - which started with our government printing money. The issue is partly tied to the US's Fed, and the Bank of Canada's decision to keep interest rates far too low for far too long. We had inflation up to like 12% during COVID. Inflation is mostly under control now, the price of everything has gone up because of the aforementioned taxes and the inflationary effects of out of control interest rates, government spending, and too be blunt: the spending habits of Canadians too. I don't only blame Trudeau, but he's part of the equation.
3. The next big issue is government debt - which he doubled. He came into like $600 billion in debt, which itself is exceedingly bad for Canada, and we're sitting at $1.17 trillion and rising. We pay $50 billion a year in interest on that debt (which is about twice the budget of our entire military for reference).
4. The next big issue is government on the take. It's not unique to Trudeau, we've always had a problem of the federal government getting paid way too well to accomplish way too little, but since COVID, it's gotten excessive with more WFH for federal employees, etc. Basically, it's one reason our government spending cannot be reigned in.
5. The next big issue is scandal after scandal - PRC election interference that seems to have benefitted Trudeau (but the truth is presently being covered up by him and his party). Paying out billions on the lie of residential schools (we never found the mass graves and we're not allowed to go look), WE Charity, ARRIVECAN, SNC Lavalin, and so on... 
6. Unconstitutional laws for example: (1) the use of the Emergency Measures Act for the truckers, and (2) the plastics ban.
7. Calling people who don't vote for him racists, misogynists, and extremists. Generally talking down to people and treating people as peasants.
8. Liberal policies are generally out of touch - (1) like more money for housing to build more housing, at a time when people have less money: it doesn't fix the issue of affordability; (2) uncontrolled immigration: 1,000,000 immigrants a year from wherever, makes no sense; we need economic migrants, not just people on welfare; (3) Hiking capital gains taxes at a time when we have a hard time attracting investment capital into Canada and then making professional pay even more in tax. (4) Going all in on green policies at a time when we cannot afford them (like making electric cars mandatory) and failing to deliver on certain green policies (like planting trees). (5) having lax bail for criminals without actually addressing ""root causes"" of crime resulting in more crime. (6) having drugs given to the addicts as ""safe supply"" without the corresponding treatment centres to make it work to help them get clean resulting in more addicts, and more overdoses...
9. Online censorship laws keep getting passed along with media bailouts for dying legacy media brands. It's just an attempt to control the MSM.
10. He's an idiot. He's good at winning elections, and nothing else. Listen to him speak; he doesn't make any sense.

Like, it's hard to put into words just how bad a leader Trudeau really is, and every Liberal and NDP MP is complicit because they back him on every single bill/policy. Canada is going to be paying for these decisions for decades. We're going to be paying for the debt for decades. And Trudeau and his cohorts don't care. They're not in it for the Canadian people; they're in it for the pension, the connections, and the perks.

"Fun fact! We had a federal byelection (a member of parliament retired so the seat needed to be filled) in a riding that had voted in a Federal Liberal for roughly 30 years. Even during the worst year the Liberals had this riding stayed part of them. All eyes  were on it and money was it staying Liberal even if they only barely won.

Well that all changed Monday when a Conservative candidate actually won the election and after an extremely high voter turnout. The Liberals brought in almost all their heavy hitters to sway things, including the deputy Prime Minister to talk, but it didn't work. All we kept hearing was that people liked the Liberal candidate but did not want to vote for them the Trudeau in charge. 

I think the Federal Liberals are in for a major knockback come the next election, people are really fed up with Trudeau and the people around him and it will be taken on the party as a whole. On top of that people are not voting for the next most liberal party, the NDP, as they have been collation partners with the Liberals to keep them in power which is now hurting them.

"Some points (I live in Calgary):
1) It's probably not accurate to say that Canada is trending ideologically to the right. It is probably more accurate to say that Canadians are punishing incumbents. After all the NDP just won a resounding victory against the incumbent Conservatives in Manitoba, and polling for the CAQ in Quebec has collapsed in favour of the centre-left Parti Quebecois. 
2) If you only read political comms, you might be tempted to think that the carbon tax is deeply unpopular. However polling data suggests that most Canadians support the continued existence of the tax, but they just don't want to see it increased (at least during this current wave of cost of living pressures).
3) Poilievre has been very vocal about abolishing the consumer carbon tax, but hasn't said anything about the industrial carbon tax. This is significant as the vast majority of carbon emissions are covered under the industrial pricing regime, not the consumer regime. Thus, it is possible that the majority of Canadian GHG emissions would remain subject to a carbon pricing regime under a Poilievre government.
4) Despite this, and also despite Poilievre's pro gay marriage, pro-choice stance (the latter of which he has made unambiguously clear), Canadians as far as I can tell don't see him as a moderate at all. This is probably due to his tone, and also because of his association with the freedom convoy, and his recent suggestion that he might use the notwithstanding clause to abrogate parts of the charter of rights and freedoms that he doesn't personally like. He was also recently videoed as he stopped off at an anti-carbon tax protest where the protestors had insignia from Diagolon, a far right Neo-Nazi organization. I would therefore not refer to Poilievre as a moderate.
5) Chrystia Freeland is not popular by any stretch of the imagination. She is deeply implicated with the Trudeau government, and is seen as out of touch. She has a stilted speaking style which screams political insider, and she is useless at political comms (as are most of the Liberal party despite having had 9 years to practice). Despite this, Freeland is incredibly smart and handled the foreign ministry extremely well, especially when dealing with the chaos and idiocy brought about by the Trump presidency.

"It’s because life is becoming hard in Canada. 
The Conservatives are getting quite a bit of young voters, and it honestly isn’t because young Canadians are super right-wing ideologically. They’re afraid of never having a house, never being able to retire, not having access to a family doctor… many things. It’s difficult to say if it’s all Trudeau and the Liberals’ faults— but the people just want something else.
It’s already been long enough under the Liberals, that people are becoming disillusioned by the promise that it will pay off in the “long term” when it has already been a decade and they feel worse off than before. These young people who are surveying Conservative now were the ones that once had faith in and put the Liberals where they are.
The liberals haven’t really done much to establish that they truly can deliver what they promise and they can’t really shake off the smug, hypocritical and self serving image they’ve built.

Plus Pollievre isn’t unhinged or offensive enough to be attacked for being a fascist nazi ala the US conservatives either. Nobody actually likes him, but he’s not horrible presenting enough that people would subject themselves to Trudeau again to avoid him.


Also. Freeland isn’t really that popular.","[""I noticed that there are some attacks based on his support of the convoy but it's not sticking. \nPierre has been good at positioning himself as a representative of the people...where that's true or not.

He’s not afraid to be direct and specific about addressing problems because it “isn’t the fault” of *his* government. \nLike a little while back when he addressed the housing crisis, he mentioned the costs of the bureaucracy and how policy makes it tough on builders with expensive building permits and heavy taxation— how the government takes so much more than all the blue collar workers trying to build us more homes. How they don’t seem to take into account complaints…\nI have a good amount of friends who work in that industry, part of small companies and as sole proprietors hiring contractors. He echoes all of their complaints with almost pinpoint accuracy. Whether he is honest or not, they are feeling heard and they feel like they have *some* chance that a person will advocate for them.\nI am a somewhat recent grad and studied social sciences and I had always leaned a bit more Liberal as a result, but I do know of a somewhat detrimental tendency of the Liberal base to turn off moderate voters who may believe in a few of the things Conservatives push… This is the tendency to insult the intelligence of Conservative voters or criticize the perceived lack of thought going into the decisions of Liberal—>Conservative voters. Yes, it may make them seem sensible in their own circles or in the world of academia, but it really does make them come off as jerks living in ivory towers politically. \nThe Trudeau government I understand wants to point at their successes too, but an overly positive portrayal makes them come off as disingenuous and as you said— lacks a sense of responsibility.', ""teh Canadian right is centre left... they are classical liberal.

"I think it is part of this ongoing anti-incumbent sentiment we are seeing across the globe.

But the Carbon Tax doesn’t actually cause economic harm, it could have some negative impacts initially, but is actually good for economic growth and job creation. Australia used to have one and after Australia’s former conservative PM Tony Abbott appealed it, many Australian businesses pleaded with the AU government to bring it back. But I do understand why many are frustrated, especially with the recent inflation and surge in prices in our post-COVID 19 global economy, mainly because of an increasing money supply as countries around the world saw rapid economic recovery in 2021 and 2022. But inflation is cooling, which could hold well for incumbents in the United States and Canada. 

Also, in the United States, if Trump wins in November (which is very possible) that may hold well for Canadian conservatives.

"buying a house here is ridiculous, but building one is even more crazy. my parents did it in 2022 and it was a nightmare from start to finish with so much desk jumping in our city just trying to get one thing done. the price of properties is insane. my parents lucked out on a 5acre property on the very outskirts of my city (its 3 hours from the GTA) and they paid 70k for it, while the properties beside them all went for over 100k. just for the freaking property, nothing done to it, not including the building permits and all that fun jazz. my parents got lucky they bought a beaver home so their building material prices got locked in. building material is inflated, you're constantly waiting on the city to stamp your paperwork, and then the workers they did hire did a shit job that resulted in my dad having to go behind them and fix their mistakes. So, if building is a nightmare, and buying a home or renting is out of price range, guess tent cities are our next bet?","[""It's an actual shit show with no light at the end of the tunnel.

Those mortgage rates were around 2% or even less. So now in the next few years those over half a million $ homes that people got will not be able to afford it if those mortgage renewals become 5-6%.

"Trudeau got into power by championing popular issues.  He won a lot of voters over when he legalized weed.  He acted like he championed freedom, but slowly he became more and more woke.  He attacked a free press, he put in online 'hate' speech laws and he has done nothing to help the housing crisis.  The final straw is his carbon tax which is killing our economy.  

The conservatives are being smart.  In Canada, when the conservatives stick to economic issues, they win elections and they are constantly pushing economic issues right now.  The problem is that the party is run by social conservatives and if they push their religion  on others, the conservatives will quickly lose popularity.

The ones listed here are pretty much just his pre-COVID list.  Trudeau ignored alerts made by national security advisors about political interference by hostile foreign powers (mainly because they seemed to benefit him and his Liberal party).  He decriminalized the use of fentynal and other hard drugs in BC, who now is reporting skyrocketing OD death rates.  Crime rates are on the rise across the board, and his ""catch and release"" policies have made this a normal statistic for the average Canadian.  There continually is a flood of immigrants into the country under refugee status who are unprepared in every waybpossible, with no support.  For example; during our last winter, an Ethiopian widowed mother of 3 kids was homeless and was found dead.  She froze to death, only having been in Canada for a few months, and who knows what fate her now orphaned kids face now.  By contrast; it took over a year for my wife to get her PR status, 7 years for citizenship, several government issued records with enough personal info to write a novel, and a gurantor for a place to live for at least 4 years who has an annual income of at least $45k.

I haven't voted Liberals since high school, and back then, i was too naive to know or understand the nuances of each party.  You make a great promise, I voted for you.  I now vote along the lines of what makes sense under the current situation, feesible promisses.

"Trudeau answers record debt by spending more. Solves record inflation by taxing more. Have a record housing crisis? Pour as many immigrants into the country as you can. Makes as much sense as solving record crime by catch and releasing criminals. Drug addiction becomes a record problem.... just let them do it anytime, anywhere. All good. Throw in a few missing million here, a few there. He's been caught in a scandal more times than actually being caught answering a straight forward question. Living like a rockstar on tax payers dollars while a quarter of the country is in poverty (yet another record for us) and crying for a brake. Latest bill being over $220K on 6 days worth of catering on a jet. Ya, just food.

Canada Day has become more of a gimmick to tourists and immigrants than a proud national holiday. Foreigners can block roads, make noise and occupy areas to protest what's going on halfway across the world without scrutiny. Yet Canadian citizens protesting what's going on here at home causes the emergency act to be activated and supporters of said protests had bank accounts frozen. He's declared his admiration for China's way of doing things on numerous occasions. And during all this. He still can look at the camera and say we've got it better than everyone else or ""he's just one of us"".

The left now wants to label Conservatives and their voters as ""far"" right to hide the fact they've been running further and further from the middle ground where shaking hands on anything has become impossible. This has worn it's welcome with the majority of Canadians, so the left melded their parties and sold every minority on the idea ""It's against your fundamental rights to be told what to do, so tell everyone else what to do instead"". All the while blasting anyone who merely questions that logic as being extreme nationalists and wanting to kill democracy.

"Incumbent fatigue in Canada is very real. The last 4 PM's who've won at least 1 majority government have only lasted, on average, 9.5 years: Mulroney, Conservative (9 years),Chretien, Liberal (10 years), Harper, Conservative (9 years) and now Trudeau, who will be at 10 years in 2025. And although the next election is ""scheduled"" for 2025, Trudolf only has a minority govt which means, if the NDP pull their support, his government could fall at any time. As for a replacement for him, the current frontrunner is Mark Carney, not Freeland. The latter, having been tied to Trudeau for the last 9 years has hurt her and most Liberals want to see a fresh face as well -- and that would be the former Bank of England chairman, not Freeland.

However, in a recent interview, he doesn't think the average Canadian is ""thinking about elections right now"" so therefore the pollsters are wrong and therefore, will probably not resign before the election. Which I'm actually pleased about. Because I want him humiliated on Election Day (some seat projections now have him in 4th place ... let's try and make that 5th place with the Greens getting 2 seats and the Liberals getting 1 ... let's hope for that scenario. I want to punish Trudolf as much as possible so much so that not even the Davos crowd will want to have anything to do with him.)

Because one thing I more and more these days is the sarcastic remark ""Thanks Trudeau"" whenever someone has to pay more for gasoline, groceries, or anything else. The point is that whenever we go shopping we are actually constantly reminded of the failures of this socialist-backed Liberal minority government ... believe me Trudeau, people think about how you've ruined their lives on a daily basis. They simply don't care about the average Joe or Jill at all. All Trudeau wants to do is impress his Davos buddies at the WEF for taking action over the greatest hoax inflicted on mankind (i.e., global warming). And when any democratically-elected leader puts the globalist elites (who never voted for him) ahead of all of his struggling citizens, and all the BS we have to put up with because of his failed leadership, then that is the time that that leader must go.

I hope the Libs wake up and change leadership before things  get too out of hand.","[""It is mathematically impossible to collect a tax and give more money back. If this were true why don't they raise the carbon tax to $50,000 and give me $70,000 back. \n\nWhat do you do with your refund? Simple, you use it to purchase goods and services all made from or brought to you by oil. That makes it pointless. \n\nPlus, you have to set up the bureaucracy that looks after all of this which costs millions which is wasteful. \n\nYou're also ignoring that we don't get squat back for the rising costs of everything else that's going up because of rising energy prices. When you raise the price of energy you raise the price of everything and there's no rebate for any of it. \n\nLastly, if you people really cared about global emissions, which you clearly don't, you'd be advocating that Canada export LNG to both India and China so they could wean themselves off of coal, generating the largest reduction in global emissions in history."", ""@@anthonymorris5084 first of all I don't know where you are getting your economics information but wealth redistribution works in a very simple way, the more you make the more you pay, large corporations who consume a disproportionate amount of  emissions pay the largest percentage of that, that money is then re distributed back to the people in rebates every quarter, corporations aren't receiving rebates so the money is leaving their pockets and is instead, going into ours making up the extra money you seem to think is magic or something. \n\nalso purchasing goods and services that emit carbon don't make the tax pointless, i don't even understand the mental gymnastics you took to get to that lmao. the point of the tax is to encourage corporations and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and make a shift towards clean energy (something that has proven to work as our carbon emissions continue to drop) if we don't have any carbon control policies we are just going to end up making thins a whole lot worse over time and corporations are going to take advantage.\n\nyour third point is stupid, obviously high energy prices cost more, the carbon tax isn't going to make up for all inflating factors associated with that rise only for itself which it dose and some. the only good argument that came come out of what you said is that the government should do a inquiry into the price of energy and see what the real costs are and why these companies are making so much profit when they claim inflation is hurting them so bad.\n\nlastly china and India are developing nations with over a billion people respectively yet we still have a third of India's emissions with a a 24th of their population, if you don't see the problem with that I don't know what to tell you... China is also the largest investor in green energy world wide and is rapidly shifting away from coal, the fact is that it takes time to one, lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and two pivot into clean energy in the process doesn't make a carbon tax pointless, china is absolutely doing a fantastic job at doing both of those things despite its problematic governance."", '@@danielcassar8293 When you have to hurl personal attacks to express an argument, you just become a tantrum throwing infant and loose all credibility. \r\n\r\nThere is no need for a carbon tax. It\'s the most ridiculous objective I\'ve ever heard of. Data clearly shows that the Earth is suffering from a dearth of CO2. It has only been this low twice in 600 million years. It has averaged 3000ppm over this time period and life flourished. Mammals existed and thrived at 3000ppm. The Earth was covered in jungle all the way to the Arctic Circle and the largest herbivores the planet has ever seen walked the Earth.\r\n\r\nNOAA graphs clearly show that over the last 800,000 years CO2 levels bounced continuously from around 180 to 300. Absolutely dangerous record lows. Below 150 and all plant life begins to die. CO2 is not a pollutant, it\'s plant fertilizer. It\'s also logarithmic, meaning the more you add, the less effect it has on warming. It\'s a positive not a negative. Warming has *proven* to be mostly benign, easily managed and a net benefit to humanity. \r\n\r\nEnergy is fundamental to human flourishing. Energy is everything. Raising the price of energy is an absurd concept. It raises the price of everything from BMW\'s to flat screen TVs. Even the necessities of life from health care to food production. It\'s collective suicide. \r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as ""clean"" or ""green"" energy. This is willful language manipulation. Please enlighten me, how is bull dozing farms, meadows, forests, deserts and jungles to lay hectares of useless panels ""green"" energy. This represents permanent and unprecedented plant and animal habitat destruction. I thought that this was what we were trying to avoid. \r\n\r\nPropagating the trope that oil companies are making ""so much profit"" is also absurd. Would you like me to send you the list of bankrupt Canadian oil companies over the last 15 years. Suncor shares are below their 2007 price. If they\'re making ""so much profit"" why don\'t you purchase shares and join in the windfall that doesn\'t exist. \r\n\r\nWe have a third (if this is even true) of India\'s emissions because we are a wealthy nation with a high standard of living that endures extreme temps in both winter and summer. Connect the dots - When the people of India reach our standard of living they will blow us out of the water. This is the link you\'re ignoring. Energy poverty is linked to actual poverty. \r\n\r\nChina is doing a horrible job. A simple Google search will show you how many coal plants China plans to build this year alone. China uses more coal in a year, than the US has used in it\'s entire history. Wrap your head around that. China uses fossil fuels to manufacture solar panels that they sell to the gullible West.']",2024-06-23T04:20:29Z,@danielcassar8293

Really Canadian’s know very little about Canadian issues or news. A huge majority consume strictly American media. Especially those on the right or of a religious persuasion. So most Canadians are caught up in US identity politics. People hate Trudeau because he’s is effeminate and woke. They are angry about open borders and high inflation. Basically ask a red hat what they hate about Biden, a Canadian conservative will say exactly the same about Trudeau.

"When I lived in Europe I thought that Trudeau is loved by everyone, then I went to live in Canada for some six months, and found out that most people hate him, that was about 6 years ago. I didn't quite get it yet, saw some controversies, but ultimately I thought that Trudeau isn't much worse than an average politician. I came to visit Canada just lat year, and holy shit, it felt like a different country, even the vibe among the people felt different. Everyone seemed pissed and worried, you could feel the tension on the streets and in the customer service, ""fuck Trudeau"" signs and stickers could be found on every corner, and honestly, I can see why. The mass, uncontrolled migration changed the country, streets where I used to live and feel safe at, turned into drug addicts hangout spots, I saw people smoking crack in the middle of the day for the first time in my life, garbage was all around, shouting, aggresive middle eastern and south asian people could be heard 24/7. I have never seen more public displays of violence than in my 3 weeks in Toronto/Mississauga.

I have a Canadian passport from birth, and always thought that if my life goes to shit in Europe I can always move to Canada and try my luck there, after my short visit last year I am sad to say that this is no longer the case. Canada is in a terrible spot, all due to corruption, uncontrolled mass migration with zero adaptation system, profiting off of rentals, profitable jobs and businesses moving to the US. Canada is absolutely fucked. Canadians are leaving Canada for the US or Europe, because they don't see the future in Canada anymore, and they're being replaced with cheap labor imported in millions. It's devasating to see how a country - that less than a decade ago - was seen as a ""dream country"" to live in, land of acceptance and opportunities, turn into a border-line failed state, that's better to be avoided.","[""Everything you listed are just typical symptoms of neoliberal policies (although the take on migration is just revisionism). \n\nThe sad reality is that while Trudeu fucked it up, the conservatives won't be making things any better.

"To sum up why we do not like him.

1) He is taxing the country into poverty. 
2) He is spending tax dollars frivolously on things that do not benefit Canadians. 
3) He is corrupt and has had interference on several accounts. 
4) He lacks accountability and evades all questions that showcase his incompetence. 
5) He has 5% of the population going to food bank shelter's, he has not addressed housing shortages, and he allows bail for many crimes.

Our current PM disrespects our indigenous communities and veteran's. He also severely impacted our relation with India in a negative way and has dressed in racially offensive costume's (blackface). He also is attempting to figure out how to allow Canadian residents (not citizens) to vote in the election. This is where his new open door flooding of immigration is working in favour of him. Despite lacking social means and housing to support them. He also ruined our chances to gain tech giants to house facilities in Canada by wishing to levy strict tax laws. Therefore, losing jobs. He also wishes to have a factory that brings in foreign workers on contracts instead of hiring Canadians to perform jobs in Canada.

He has raped these poor immigrants savings and they have no option but to live on the streets. He has spent billions of tax dollars on housing initiatives that only produce unobtainable housing.

"The Trudeau gov't gleefully ignored the intelligence community regarding a chinese diplomat running amok, threating members of parliament and extorting them until a news agency reported that they were doing nothing and knew, and it wasnt until after the story broke. They finally deported the guy. Funny thing is their in-action on that scandal led to a broader investigation regarding foreign interferrence by people outside of their control. An investigation which they vehemently tried to stop from happening which also found that there was members of gov't, (currently unverified but most likely liberal cabinet members based on the RCMP and legal language regarding due process) that are currently, and have been for some time assisting foreign gov't in undermining Canadian policy making. And even in some cases leaking top secret intelligence information. Essentially they're traitors. 

Good ol fashion traitors who are sitting on cabinet. You cant make this stuff up its crazy. 

Then theres the consulting firm scandal with GS strategies. 250+ million given to liberal friends to sub contract out tech contracts. The ceo of which was the first Canadian hauled infront of parliament and held in contempt of parliament in my life time. 

The we charity scandal ( Trudeau family members taking tax payer money for speaking and event engagements that was awarded to the we charity through gov't own bidding process. When Trudeau was asked how much he or his family had recieved he replied "" Its all part of the public record."" 😂 

The final results of this was Trudeau literally shutting down gov't to prevent a formal comitee invesitagation. Which resulted in covid happening and basically bailing him out.

"How quickly Canadians forget how the PC's have left our country in a financial and economic mess EVERY time they have been in power since and including Diefenbaker's reign.
It wasn't that long ago that Harper took over the government with both a Financial Surplus and a thriving economy and low unemployment rate. Justin Trudeau was handed a huge deficit, high unemployment and oil that was worth NOTHING. 
I do NOT like Justin Trudeau although he has done some great things such as Decriminalizing Marijuana and recovering our economy. However, he did so at a great financial cost resulting in even higher debt. Corporate GREED is what has kept the cost of everything high which is nothing the PM or US's President appear to be able to do anything about. 
But Trudeau does have a Crooked streak in him. He has had his nose too deep in several questionable activities and organizations.

"Sorry, I got carried away, but I think this is a fair explanation of where Canadian politics are going : 

Trudeau had a lot of the younger generations vote him in on the promise of legalizing Marijuana, which he did do, ten years ago. However by failing to uphold promises to make Canada less dependent on petrol by investing in renewable energy and keeping a tighter leash on environmental issues, he lost a lot of them. The younger gen is dubious of the place of petrol in Canadian economy and it might sound like environmentalist whining, but there is a point to be made when we realize that most of US gas comes from Canada and that we somehow pay more per gallon than them. Why can't we transform our own raw petrol instead of selling it cheap to the US and having to buy it back once it's refined? Why do we have to rush building a potentially dangerous pipeline across the country when most of the money made from petrol benefits the US before us? When you risk polluting deep soft water reserves for centuries to come, asking for research and risk mitigation isn't an extreme left-wing demand, it's common sense.

The older generation had an attachment to the Trudeau brand in politic. P-E Trudeau was a controversial figure, but he was a very skilled economist and he knew how to run an efficient budget. He also had a charismatic authority and important allies. Justin's leadership was too lax in comparison and the older generation felt let down by his lack of decisiveness and authority from the start.


There are also the strategic left wing voters. Before Trudeau, the conservative party was in power for a while, there was a rise in religious discourse in politics, and people from the left wanted change FAST. They knew the NPD, the Bloc Q, the Green parties and others stood no real chance, so they voted for Trudeau to prevent a conservative government, not because they liked Trudeau, but because he was seen as easier to work with for opposition parties. Now, the discourse has changed, the left wing holds no more faith in centrist govs like the Liberal party and actually has a shot at getting some seats now that Trudeau's ratings are all the way down.


On a PR perspective, Trudeau's brand was based on his youth and his father's legacy. His smiling persona of the regular guy that wants to get along with everybody works well for campaigning, but when it comes to imposing authority as the leader of the federal government, nobody could take him seriously. 

We are in a recession, so people will vote conservative, and on an economic standpoint that WILL help Canada survive the rough patch to come, but we have to be on high alert because the conservative party is a very hold institution and it comes with strings attached, which sometimes means corruption. The likelihood of Canada relying less on the US is unlikely during a Conservative term because of these historical bonds between the rich and powerful that fund the conservative party, but, considering the US dollar fell on it's face, it might be the road to protect Canada. The other threat that opposition parties will have to keep in mind is the rise of the extremist movements that are already underway, recession means a rise of poverty, poverty leads to fear and that's when the most vulnerable are easily radicalized, in both the extreme-left and the extreme-right.

So far, Poilièvre is looking pretty solid in the medias. I think he has a much better grasp of economy than Trudeau, but this is campaigning, so what you see might not be what we get once he is in power ( because by now, it's pretty much a given that he'll win). I'm cautiously hopeful that he might have the authority to truly defend Canada's interest and not get pupeteered like the leaders before him, but we've been let down before, so don't get your hopes too high up!",[],2024-06-19T18:53:27Z,@firasghazoua3395

For most of the country (geographically) it’s not realistically possible. 2) the knock on effect it’s had on transportation costs for a country as large as Canada has been huge, driving up cost of living, be it food or building materials.

"Many Canadian voters, especially Baby Boomers, were appalled by the Liberal cannabis rollout. They merely broadly legalised medical cannabis, which was designed to contain zero psychotropic properties. They made no provisions to pardon and legally employ experts from the illegal cannabis undergrounds. They were repulsively vague in the writing of the Act, and gave far too much power over interpretation of and implementation of the Act to each province. Many new cannabis ventures, after investing hundreds of thousands of Canadian dollars, went bankrupt within the first year or two of legalisation.

Instead of creating a Ministry of Controlled Substances, the Liberals put Cannabis into the hands of Health Canada. Who permit vaping!

To add insult to injury, for more than a year into legalisation, disgustingly bad cannabis (wet, filters too tight, gummy, unlightable and absolutely unsmokable product) was being churned out of Smith Falls, Ontario, where monopolists, somehow, had secured a stranglehold on marijuana production.

Quality is still bad: very low grade, non-psychotropic products are legally available. Better stuff can be had on the Black Market. Recent online surveys, to be taken into account in assessing future legislation, was worded in such a manner that every question led to agreement--Stay the course. You're doing wonderfully. Don't change a thing. Good job!! --BUT we could write a comment at the end of the survey. Understand, Canadians are educated. Treat us as infants and we react. At the polls.

Above 40% of us who would purchase legal marijuana eschew that market. And, please take note, some who voted at every Federal and Provincial election, and like me, had voted only Liberal federally, will never, ever, ever vote Liberal at the Federal level again. I voted against the Liberals in 2019, and again in 2021. The Liberals went from a comfortable majority in 2015 to two consecutive minorities. Had they done the cannabis rollout decently and respectfully, I dare say that Trudeau would have outdone Sir Wilfred Laurier in the number of times he won elections.

What sticks in my craw is that when marijuana and derivatives were illegal,  the now PM of Canada had the funds for and access to the very finest cannabis on Earth, and you can wager any amount you wish that he obtained, and consumed, the best.

I like Trudeau. He's done considerable good. But he totally, absolutely had no excuse to foul up cannabis legalisation. He announced the process on the symbolic day that his father as PM tried to legalise marijuana: so Justin Trudeau and the Liberals had 50 years, 600 months, 2,609 weeks, and, rounded, 28,262 days to make legalisation GOOD. 

I'll never trust the federal Liberal Party of Canada again. And, unsurprisingly, I am in plentiful company.

"This video is a joke.
Trudeau is unpopular because of his incompetence not because of his scandals. Sure those scandals play a minor role, but he has impacted so many Canadians so negatively that it is not even funny. I will take the most recent example. His government passed bill C-56 the Affordable Housing and Groceries Act. Suppose to improve housing affordability. . . Guess what 4 months later, the government fees for new development charges in Toronto and Vancouver increased from 20k to as high as 80k per unit. Literally single-handedly made housing more expensive to build by 10% in just 4 months after the affordability bill went into action. His government has so little idea of how to implement things that they don't just screw things up, they literally do the opposite of what they intend to achieve. 

Not only the incompetence of his government, his government is so ideology driven that they have no priority on the needs of Canadians. They are defending their policies with arguments on climate change when it result in tent cities spring up across the major cities. Liberal government introduces taxes on capital gains to discourage investments so that they can achieve ""generational fairness"" when Canadian workers are at rock bottom productivity because machinery and tools are heavily under-invested compared to their peers abroad.

5) Actively pushing and promoting pure racist policies under the guise of
    diversity, equity, and inclusion
6) Being incompetent at anything they touch, and hiring people not based
    on their competence, but on their color, .ex, or race
7) Being so arrogant that they think they know better than the parents of
    children
8) Accusing Canadians of .enocide. When they truth is now coming out
     that no .urdered .ative children’s remains have been found
9) Diminishing and debasing the term genocide to the extent that it has become meaningless.
10) Making massive payouts from the tax base for stories that happened
     over 150+ years ago with no basis in fact, history, or reality
11) Branding people who protest Liberal polices as right-wing extremists

"In the 60+ years of living in Canada I can tell you that life was much much better when we first came to Canada. There was a lot less taxation and jobs were plentiful. Believe it or not we paid about $10 for a grocery cart full of stuff. 
Houses were cheap too. I bought my first house about 1982 for $35 000. It was a small one bedroom with a full basement. I had a full time job. Life was good.
But in 1986 Pierre Trudeau became prime minister. Soon thereafter we endured skyrocketing inflation. I still remember renewing my mortgage for 18%! Then factories starting laying off workers. Some factories closed. Many people lost their homes. 
Since then taxes  have been increasing and new taxes have been invented. Somebody invented the capital gains tax. Another person invented the gst tax. Trudeau invented the carbon tax. 
Now everything is so expensive and work is scarce. Taxes have increased a lot and made life very expensive. The house I bought for $35 000 now costs about $300 000! Throughout the years almost every political party succeeds in wasting and spending too much money. The deficit keeps going up and up. The politicians never seem to be able to balance the budget but always give themselves nice raises and pensions. Recently the MPs got a 4% raise, Seniors over 75 got 10% more for OAS. Other seniors got nothing. WTF!!!!
Poilievre wants to axe the carbon tax and balance the budget. He is heading in the right direction certainly. He has uncovered so much corruption and waste of money by the Liberals. Check out  How Trudeau's failed vaccine deal with China wasted millions | The Vaccine    Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOyHzeREL98&t=1629s
Add those millions to the millions spent and wasted and stolen with the ArriveCan App. Overall Trudeau is spending far too much and we have more problems than ever in this country. Although he manages to cling to power he is not at all benefitting Canadians and making our lives better. I believe and know that Trudeau has made a big mess of Canada.

"Really the problem is he's done very little at all as a leader, other than legalizing cannabis, the carbon tax, and global agreements. Not any big wins for the public, especially lately.

Anyone who thinks he's not a centrist and has gone too far left needs to read up on politics and stop listening to the news thats all been bought out by private conglomerates. He's a lazy and incompetent leader, doesn't mean his goals are left-wing. He's not going to implement any actual left wing ideas like expanding democracy, universal pharma, long-term care, eye-care or dental care. He's no going to make post secondary school and training programs free. He's not going to make any big social food programs, or housing. Or give unions more rights. I would love it myself if we copied what the Soviet Union did with housing and make commie blocks (which was praised by their citizens) for those who need housing, and ground the prices for the real-estate bubble. We don't need to do the other tings though. Or we can make public high-speed trains like in europe or Asia, we mostly all live close tp the border.

"Some context
- Half of the things Trudeau is being blamed for are because of factors mostly outside his control, areas of jurisdiction that are mostly controlled by the provinces and other levels of government, or things that have been caused by decisions that long predated him. Housing is a good example where the problem is mostly a provincial and municipal responsibility in Canada and was caused by policies decided on around 30 to 40 years ago. Unfortunately many people have been unable to distinguish this and seem to disproportionately blame the federal government regardless. 
- Much of Trudeau's failure has been being slow to react or responding to problems on the scale needed. Though he is also constrained in many cases since he either doesn't have jurisdiction to act directly.
- Most Canadians didn't and still don't agree with the ""Freedom Convoy"", which was nominally a protest against mandatory vaccination for truck drivers, but was really a protest against COVID restricts in general. Much of these Covid restrictions were actually decided at the provincial level and not something Trudeau controlled directly, but the people protesting them did not seem to understand the difference in jurisdiction. 
- Pollievre is mostly benefitting from the ""throw the bums out sentiment"" and being the default alternative, but isn't very popular himself. He's also pointing out a lot of problems repeatedly, but not really offering a lot of in depth or workable solutions. He's putting out political slogans lie wanting ""to make Canada the freest country in the world"" or getting rid of these nebulous ""gatekeepers"" without explaining directly how or what this is supposed to mean in most instances.","['"" Housing is a good example where the problem is mostly a provincial and municipal responsibility...""  While housing is not under his direct control, the Housing crisis is a symptom of a number of other federal policies.  While the ball got rolling before him, he has exacerbated the issue rather than fix it in the near decade he\'s been in power.\n\n""He\'s also pointing out a lot of problems repeatedly, but not really offering a lot of in depth or workable solutions.""  This is a strange line to continue to parrot when Poilievre is literally putting out video essays explaining some of his policies and the reasoning behind them in detail.  Frankly, it\'s also reasonable to keep those cards close to the chest because there have been some recent incidences of the Liberals just using the Conservative\'s proposed solutions outright.', ""@@Silver-Rays Most of Canada's economic, housing and social problems are caused by too much population growth and dependence on temporary foreign labor.

"""Economy, carbon tax, housing crisis, scandals SNC lavalin, emergencies act, incumbent fatigue."" are listed as to why he is so unpopular in Canada.
I wouldn't say so.
The guy in 2015 bullt up a strong political capital with his message of ""positive politics"" and he didn't follow through, instead spending it all with non answers, redactions, giving us legislation no one voted for,...
He promised us three small deficit budgets for a max of 30 billion in new debt 2015-19 and he gave us 60.
Not one canadian voted for that much debt 2015-19.  Some voted for 30, no one for the 60 we got and that's where his debt/deficit polling problems started for him.
It was his spending of political capital that has cost him.  
Had he kept to his ""Positive Politics"" ideals provided answers, didn't redact, he would have had the political capital to keep polls up through times when he had to make the difficult, unpopular decisions that he wanted.
""Is the carbon tax going to be added before or after the GST."" was asked multiple times to no answer, ""Why is there a gun on the potential list of firearms that has never been used in a cry me"" was asked multiple times and answered with deflections.  One was asked 18 times in the House to no answer.  Google ""Trudeau asked 18 times.""
Deflections instead of answers, outright refusing to answer, redactions as happened with SNC., failing to provide documents to committees-happening now with election interference,...

Carbon Tax
I believe it's widely agreed by economists that this is one of the less costly and more effective ways to encourage people using gasoline and diesel powered vehicles to consider moving to alternatives that don't produce greenhouse gases, like EVs or perhaps hydrogen some day although the infrastructure for EVs is lacking outside of large urban centres and for hydrogen it effectively doesn't exist. This 'tax' is paid at the pump but is rebated through the income tax system in quarterly cheques. The Parliamentary Budget Office has confirmed that for most people the rebated amount exceeds the cost of the tax - i.e they don't lose money because of it. There is still controversy over how much this tax has generally affected cost of transport for goods and services and contributed to cost-push inflation at a time when this is a major concern for many voters. 

The Canadian petroleum industry has seen this tax and Trudeau's other climate change policies as a threat to its profits and investment and the Conservative Party of Canada essentially represents that view. If the Conservatives win next year, I expect to see any genuine Canadian effort to minimize climate change to be gutted and replaced by mere lip service and arguments like 'percentage wise Canada produces so little GHG that it's not worth losing money trying to restrict them and we may as well ""drill baby drill"" '.

Canada's Housing Crisis
IMHO the prime purpose of owning a house should be accommodation not wealth creation, but this has never been addressed from what I've seen. AFAIK no effort has ever been made to restrain the cost of housing since the late 80s. This predates the Trudeau government and has been allowed to continue under both Liberal and Conservative/PC governments. Even the late 80s people were buying Toronto houses sight unseen for astronomical sums then flipping them for substantial profit 6 months or a year later.  IMHO this may be very profitable but forces up the cost of unimproved housing and is totally unproductive in a country where commercial or industrial investment is notoriously hard to find.

Meanwhile a birth rate of 1.6 babies per couple means that more Canadians are retiring than are entering the workforce. Consequently the tax base is shrinking just as the increasing number of aging people requiring costly medical services for which they paid though their taxes through their working lives. All Canadian governments agreed that the solution to this was large scale immigration which Trudeau really allowed to spike over the last couple of years. Meanwhile neither the Trudeau nor any provincial government seems to have planned for the housing, medical services, school placements etc. that these people were going to need. So a housing shortage that was already leading to ridiculous accommodation expanses in major cities like Vancouver and Toronto has shot through the roof. This has percolated down to low cost rental accommodation to the point where people on low incomes here in Halifax are being 'renovicted' from apartments where they have lived for many years and are unable to find any accommodation they can afford. Many of these people are living on the streets or in tents in public parks, which can't be much fun during the Nova Scotia winter. For these people, 'market prices' has clearly failed but government has avoided stepping in as much as possible.

Trudeau's personal scandals
There are so many it's hard to know where to begin. 
For his improperly trying to influence the (non-partisan) Attorney General to help SNC-Lavalin, a large engineering company with a record of donation to his Liberal Party to save them from facing facing well deserved corruption charges alone, he should have resigned. 

The use of the Emergencies Act was well justified IMHO but would never have been needed had the Ontario Conservative Premier not been facing an imminent election and tried to avoid taking action that could have ended the occupation and intimidation of Ottawa streets and citizens by trucks and the blocking of vital bridges essential to just in time trade with the US. The Ottawa police were ill prepared and overwhelmed, the Ontario police forces were not given the go-ahead to act in force to end this ad finally the President of the US called Trudeau to ask if he needed American assistance to clear these essential bridges. This had become an international embarrassment and nobody else appeared to be making the effort to fix it so Trudeau reluctantly stepped in and rapidly ended the whole thing. The right wing extremist fringe groups behind this are now represented by the Conservative Party, whose leader chose to appear with them during their occupation.  Polls at the time showed a  majority of Canadians supported Trudeau's actions and the court found that while he technically had exceeded the very narrow mandate on which he was allowed to invoke such extreme actions, that mandate in itself should be reviewed.

Trudeau?
IMHO Trudeau has overstayed his welcome with the Canadian public after almost a decade.  
He is utterly loathed by the right largely because he has defeated them three times but also because he has promoted climate change action over the Canadian oil industry. Poillievre is a right wing populist backed by the petroleum industry, the gun lobby and all those social conservative folks who feel Trudeau is too 'woke' for their taste.  Trudeau raised the Liberals from third party status to a majority in 2015 and and acts as though he feels they owe him the right to sink it back down once again. He should have resigned years ago and I feel that Freeland is not a viable alternative - she has spent too much time by his side. 

I expect there are many middle of the road voters who are parking their votes with the Conservatives largely because they can't stand Trudeau. It's getting late in the game now and may have to wait until after a disastrous result for the Liberals in next year's election, but the Liberal need to be seen to change the Leader ASAP and IMHO one option - were he to consider it - would be Mark Carney, former Governor of The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and a dyed in the wool Liberal. He might be able to attract swing voters who are currently willing to hold their nose and vote for Poillievre. 

Personally I think neither are a viable alternative. Both are political performers, one is wrapped in scandals and the other feels like a populist huckster.

"There is so much missed here.

1: The carbon ""tax"" is revenue neutral and Canadians get regular rebate cheques coming from the money from the carbon tax.
Most  Canadians, especially poor and middle class Canadians, get more back in money from rebate cheques than they pay in carbon tax.

Poilievre would probably get rid of the carbon tax and the carbon tax rebates but he and the Conservatives have no policy to deal with climate change, even after the 2023 wildfire season when Canada had far, far more area burned by wildfire than in any other year and Canadians and Americans found at times that it was not safe for them to go outside because their cities were choked with Canadian wildfire smoke.

Poilievre is an extreme example of a politician who complains loudly a lot but seldom has any solutions or policies.

2: There have been complaints that ""uncontrolled"" immigration is creating a housing shortage and driving up rents and real estate prices but in fact Canada actually has a sophisticated points system that determines who gets to migrate to Canada.

As well in 2021 when Canada had 38.5 million people the country took in 405,000 immigrants, the same number as Canada took in during 1913 when Canada had only 
a population of 7.6  million people to deal with absorbing that many immigrants.
The dramatic increase in the number of people coming to Canada has actually been in the number of foreign students coming to Canada but colleges and universities are under provincial jurisdiction  - it's really the provinces that are responsible for that.

Also, it always sounds a bit strange to hear opposition politicians say to Canadians, 
""We are very angry that the value of the homes you own has significantly increased unlike in places where there is demographic collapse and economic struggle so that housing values  are falling"".

3: Although they were big things at the time I don't think that many Canadians remember those scandals very well. They won't be significant election issues.

4: The right wing anti-vax extremists who occupied Ottawa and made Ottawa residents feel unsafe in their own city and tried to overthrow government because they had the bizarre idea that they had the right to replace elected politicians with their own yahoo dictatorship and that such a dictatorship could get rid of American border covid rules were likely mostly people who voted for the extremist far right anti-vax ""People's Party"" which has not won even a single seat in Parliament in two national elections.
95% of Ontario adults got vaccinated against covid and most people think that the extremists who occupied Ottawa are idiots and were glad when the occupation was shut down.
Those particular Conservative politicians who hung out with the extremists hurt themselves politically.
Anyone who was upset that the occupation was forcibly ended would be so far right that they would never vote Liberal anyway  - there's a good chance they didn't even vote for the Conservatives and voted for the fringe far right People's Party.

And the finding that the Liberal government overstepped its bounds in dealing with the occupation of Ottawa is misleading.
It's true that it should not have been necessary for the federal government to do what it did as the Ottawa police force and the Ontario government should have taken action to end the occupation but given that for weeks the Ottawa police force and the Ontario government did nothing of significance to deal with the occupation it was left up to the federal government to do something.

5: The main thing that seems to be happening as has happened in many countries is that people are angry that prices have gone up and so want to kick out the ruling party even though the ruling party has no control over most of the things that led to inflation such as lockdowns in China, problems with American ports, lots of baby boomers getting to the age when they are retiring and thus creating labour shortages and especially the Russian invasion into Ukraine.
The Liberals like many ruling parties are being blamed for global inflation which is very strange.
A lot of people just don't seem to make an effort to think about what factors are causing inflation  ....which actually has now come down quite a bit.
They also blame the government for high interest rates even though it is Canada's Central Bank that controls interest rates and which dramatically increased interest rates to deal with inflation that had been created by international factors.

6: One major way in which the Liberals have caused their own unpopularity is by more or less giving unequivocal support to Israel regardless of what horrific things Israel has done in Gaza.  This has angered many Canadians.
The Conservatives have no such problem because virtually all of their voters seem to support Israel unequivocally so they don't lose voters even if they completely ignore the plight of Palestinians.
It also won't be forgotten that the ruling Liberals have done nothing of significance to fight against a Quebec law banning anyone who wears a visible religious symbol from being hired for a public service position such as a teacher  - a law clearly meant to target the Muslim and Sikh communities.

7: As well I think that some people are fed up with the Liberals saying the right things about helping Indigenous people deal with the difficulties created by centuries of mistreatment by white authorities but actually doing and accomplishing very little.

In general Trudeau has a habit of responding to questions about issues by saying the right things with platitudes but just like an actor reading a script.

8: Conservatives need to be careful about talking about loosening gun laws  - it was doing that which contributed significantly to them losing the last election.

9: You won't likely hear Poilievre ranting about how immigrants are destroying the country.
That might go over well in some rural white communities where Conservatives are guaranteed to win seats anyway but will not go over well in large cities like 
Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver that all have very large immigrant populations.
If Conservatives do poorly in all the big cities then they won't win the election.",[],2024-06-17T17:57:27Z,@geofflepper3207

Putin thought he could siphon the state, but he built a pyramid of thieves who siphoned his precious army at every level. Xi Jinping thought he could bully his Chinese CCP, but built a pyramid of ""Wold Warrior Diplomacy"" that wrecked all foreign relationships. Sweden thought they could be super-feminists and all-inviting, but built a surge of anti-feminist Islamists.

"This is just inaccurate. The economic “pinch” isnt causing the carbon tax to suddenly be considered controversial — they straight up lied to us — average consumers were supposed to have carbon taxes paid on gas etc. to be refunded to them (plus some from taxes on corporations) at tax time - this was an outright lie - we are paying the tax and the refund is never as much as we pay. Additionally, Trudeau hasn’t “failed to fix” the housing problem — he IS the housing problem. Costs have more than doubled as a result Trudeau’s / the Liberals policies over the last decade. On top of that, Trudeau and his government have had links to organized crime exposed publicly, there are suspicions of embezzlement, fascism and foreign influence (China) while shovelling billions to Ukraine while our economy is trashed under his “leadership”. Finally, the “trucker protests” weren’t a scandal - he blatantly and directly broke Canadian constitutional LAW - illegally invoking the emergency powers act so he could silence dissidents (who were legally invoking their right to protest / free speech) by freezing their bank accounts / other assets - no charges, no trial, no conviction, no “innocent until proven guilty” - just sentencing - he acted as judge, jury and executioner like any corrupt dictator and just silenced his political opposition / civilian dissent. He shouldnt be running a country — he should be serving a life sentence for TREASON - and yet, here he is, still in power - it is LUDICROUS.

Add in his woke insanity and you have a government that supports racism against white people, sexism against men, general heterophobia and otherwise hate-cult motivated ideology while spending tax payer dollars on unisex bathrooms instead of food banks or homeless shelters or the economy (the first two regular citizens now need because he completed f’d up the third one).

Don’t think he’s a corrupt dictator? Look at the Online Harms Act - the latest of his treasonous corrupt crony government’s legislation: Now they can put you under house arrest just for being “under investigation”.. no “reasonable” time limit stipulated by the bill for them to complete the investigation - so they can effectively imprison you indefinitely just for being accused of something - again, no charges, no trial, no conviction, just sentencing. So much for innocent until proven guilty - AGAIN. Meanwhile, while you’re under house arrest - most of us need to be able to physically go to work to be able to earn money at our jobs - so we’ll lose jobs, lose our income, fail to be able to make mortgage payments, lose our houses (you know, have our lives completely ruined) - and then what? You’re supposed to be under house arrest but you no longer have a home? Oh dear.. well I guess we’ll just have to send you to a penitentiary then. — STILL HAVENT EVEN BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING. And OH YEAH - the law is RETROACTIVE!!! What does that mean? It means if you did something 20 years ago (when it wasn’t illegal) but which would NOW be illegal - yeah they can arrest you and charge you. That’s like them lowering the speed limit on a road you’ve driven to and from work everyday for the last 10 years and sending you 3,650 tickets at $110 each because they have NOW decided you were speeding all those times (even though, at the time, you were driving the speed limit). Think that’s not bad enough? There is a financial incentive for the general public to report on (read: accuse) their neighbours - nothing happens if they accuse them and nothing is ever found (aside from the accused’s life being ruined) - but if something IS found, you get tens of thousands of dollars… imagine that. Now look up the cossacks. 

The liberals aren’t losing support to the conservatives because of bad press! Are you an idiot or just a government shill?

Something else that no one really talks about is the “AAA credit rating“ the Canada likes to boast about is due in large part to the CPP or Canadian pension plan. Without getting into too much detail, the government effectively leverages Canadians pensions as credit.

- Housing is a provincial responsibility, not federal. Poillievre going after Trudeau for that is disingenuous (as are most of his points).
- Poillievre is absolutely not presenting as a moderate. He’s regularly in photo ops with known right wing extremists and neo-nazi groups. He is having a similar effect that Trump had in the US, of stirring the hearts of the bigots. 
- The carbon tax policy isn’t a failed policy, if anything it’s a failed communication. Anyone that can do math knows that it’s a net positive for most people (8/10, as confirmed by the independent parliamentary office) as you left out the rebate portion that everyone gets back. It’s Poillievre that has been lying about it, because he understands that people generally hate taxes, and is stirring that hatred in people’s hearts. 
- Most people supported Trudeau’s actions with regard to the stupid convoy. Something like 80% of Canadians were against the convoy. And those that supported it, were Conservatives.

In another way he shows his Conservative stripes. Progressives and liberals do the hard work and take all the heat of changing laws and policies during times of social change. Conservative wail and whine over same sex marriage and legalized cannabis, for example, proclaiming the world will end so as to rile up the bigots, prudes and religious zealots that they cynically rely on to bolster their support.

To get an accurate number for say college students for some reason, you should go to every university or at least every major university, instead of a handful and just scale up the numbers.

Only PM in the history of the British Empire/Commonwealth Realm to sue veterans in a legal case regarding a fight for our right to fair treatment under the law.  Trudeau has also added more overall debt to Canada’s total debt load than all other PMs combined.  In 2016 he very stupidly ended the combat mission against ISIS as our allies were ramping up for the big counter offensive to defeat ISIS, then he step over 600 million dollars aiding former ISIS fighters (traitors) to reintegrate terrorists into Canadian society instead of throwing the traitors into prison for life, at this exact same time he was suing veterans (as mentioned) and railroaded the commander of the RCN for standing up to his corruption by inventing charges his own prosecutor dropped 2 years later because the prosecutor discovered the Admiral was innocent the whole time.  Lastly, the vaccine rolled out was unnecessarily delayed due his incompetence, Canadians were the last people in the developed world to get fully vaccinated and end health restrictions.

"No mystery there.

Trudeau has been under disinformation attack since he got into office (remember the $140,000 vacation?  I tallied up the costs of the private jet, security etc. that he HAD to use and couldn't figure out how it didn't cost MORE).

Then COVID happened, and we had a mediocre response. We lost only 1 person per Capita for every 2.4 people per Capita the US lost, but people were frustrated by having our lives disrupted and still others were worked into a lather by US based conspiracy theorists who think that the Government was trying to control/kill us with a vaccine - as though a government who wants people dead needs to be subtle about it (hint... look at Israel right now).

As a result you had an occupation of Ottawa by a group of angry, misled Canadians funded by US anarchist groups, and... they blamed Trudeau for their anger and frustration.

Since then Poilievre has been leveraging and fueling anti-Trudeau sentiment to get people to vote Trudeau out so he can win by default.

I watched a Poilievre video last week, which blamed Trudeau for the homeless encampments that have appeared in Canadian cities, leaving the viewer with the impression that there are multiples more homeless than when Trudeau came into power.  But in my city, the encampments happened because urban renewal and gentrification pushed the homeless out of an old, decaying core and they wound up concentrated in the few spots that they weren't getting chased out of. Since there was no buildings there to shelter them, they erected tents.

The real pain the working class if feeling is a growing wealth gap. In 2020 alone, the top 1% in North America doubled their net worth.  Working class wages have lagged inflation and jobs that used to be high paying were off-shored and are coming back, but as non-unionized jobs paying less/hr than their unionized counter parts paid 30 years ago.

That is the result of un-checked capitalism, which ALWAYS concentrates wealth among the wealthiest.  The only significant factors that put money back in the pockets of the working class are Collective Bargaining and government wealth re-distribution (tax and spend - not the the highest standards of living are in the countries with some of the highest tax rates...)

Over the last 10 years, In Canada our baby boomers have hit retirement age and started to collect OAS, as well as using the seniors services and health care services that seniors require to have a dignified retirement.  This amounts to our biggest single tax spend. Somewhere around 30% of every tax  dollar. Bigger than the military spend(which we also have to increase, due to world events).

Since 2013, we went from having 4.1 working age people for each retiree to 3.2.  This has huge implications on our tax system and how the spending has to be apportioned. I'd love to see how Poilievre would change the subject if he ever got asked what he would do about this issue.

But, ""Blame Trudeau"" is a simple message that's easy to digest and doesn't require any knowledge of accounting, demographics or data analysis to understand.  It resonates with the people who think that interest rates are set by the PM calling up the Bank of Canada Governor and  saying ""Set them to 3.8%"".

Trudeau has become the scapegoat for every ailment every Canadian has, and Poilievre's campaign strategy of putting out a firehose of misleading ""Stub your toe? Blame Trudeau!!!"" ads is effective at making people hate Trudeau.

A buddy of mine is a great example of the net effect. He HATES Trudeau. But he also hates Poilievre and thinks he's an untrustworthy weasel.

If he's any indication, the net effect of Poilievre's American-style ""slander to win"" technique will be probably be lower voter turn out - because they hate one option and they don't trust the other one.",[],2024-06-17T16:00:13Z,@rondaniels9974
"While none of this information was wrong, it is definitely an incomplete analysis.  While many democracies are de facto 2 party systems, this is not the case in Canada.  3rd parties play a strong role in Canadian politics.  The greatest example of this is the current Conservative party who broke away from the old Conservative party some decades back, ran as a 3rd party and ultimately overtook and absorbed the old Conservatives whom they splintered from.

Important points to mention are that no significant number of the votes which the Liberals are losing are going to the socialist NDP indicated in orange.  This party has frequently in the past found itself in the position of king maker, and been able to leverage policy concessions out of the much larger parties by holding crucial support as collateral.  In the past disillusioned Liberal voters have switched to the NDP as a way to oppose the Conservatives without expressly supporting the Liberals.  This is not happening this time because currently the NDP have seemingly signed a blank cheque to the Liberals, supporting extremely controversial decisions such as funding a bitumen pipeline to the tune of 10s of billions of dollars with hardly a word said.  To the disillusioned Liberal, a vote for the NDP right now is a vote for the Liberals with extra steps, and many who wouldn't normally vote Conservative likely will this time.

Next party to talk about is the Bloc Quebecois.  They are the pale blue line near the bottom of the graph, but that graph seriously misrepresents their support.  They are the remnants of Quebec separatism, who now present themselves as a viable alternative to Quebec voters who don't like any of the other options.  Their national support is so low because they are only available in the Province of Quebec, but due to the nature of the first past the post system they usually win many seats despite their low total vote count.  If you're from the UK, think of the BQ as Canada's SNP.

Final line to talk about is the Green line.  Our Green party is seemingly incapable of getting its act together, often descending into infighting, and generally having environmental opinions based on what's trending on twitter rather than what's backed by environmental scientists or environmentally minded economists.

"Canadian here, Trudeaus carbon tax has single handily made inflation worse due to the price of everything going up as a result of taxing oil. The reason for the housing crisis is not only due to high amounts of immigration, but also due to a lot of red tape when it comes to getting building permits which increases housing costs by a lot. Our deputy prime minister Freeland is very unpopular as well and will not be a good prime minister as well. The more recent scandal is foreign interference by China, India and Russia in our elections and Trudeau is putting a lot of effort into covering it up. More recently some of our MPs are accused of helping foreign governments interfere in our elections and Trudeau refuses to give out the names of them which in a danger to democracy here.

"TL:DR - Trudeau policy is very high profile in the US, generally American ignore Canada but not under Trudeau. His failure is convenient to point to for the Right and a total embarrassment for the Left mostly from housing and healthcare.

Don't know where this idea that he people think must be popular within Canada comes from, I live in a left-wing bubble in the State and even they think he a Authoritarian monster, with even the most left-leaning disavowing him as a fascist due to his close relationships with Canada's Corporations guaranteeing them profits through crony capitalism, his statement about being envious of China, and nobody can ignore the failing healthcare which had been the crown jewel of Canada and the Housing Crisis which makes California houses looks affordable. Meanwhile, the RIght think he a joke mostly due to Jordan Peterson and the bank freeze on the Trucker Convoy, otherwise you be correct in saying they don't think of Canada at all but they do due to those reason and pointing to housing is politically convenient to draw a correlation about housing affordability. 

IMO, the housing issue while complex is absolutely Trudeau fault not only allowing NIMBYism to fester but statement by him seem to suggest they are definitely a part of his base and vision for Canada. A combination of zoning, banking, unchecked foreign land speculation by people looking to seek let call it ""dual citizenship"", and inaction. There at least appears to be direct involvement in proping up real estate prices which backfired spectacularly. The carbon policy seems tone deaf in regards to being able afford basic expenses and leaving corporation off the hook, and Canadian Tourist they whinged about their currency losing 60% of its value aboard.

"What people hated the most is his coalition with the NDP party so he has the majority in the chamber. His policy on massive immigration made the cost of housing extremely high and put pressure on health care, education and social services and those services have to be managed by the provinces. He did'nt take the foreign interference seriously and tried to deflect over and over but the conservatives kept pushing on that matter so Trudeau had no other choice but to open an investigation. His legalization of hard drugs in Vancouver has proven to be a disaster but now he wants to extend it to Toronto and Montreal. He is a disaster for Canada and people are suffering like never before.","['That\'s a generalization. What is the polling data on that? How many Canadians hate the coalition with NDP? Seems to be it would mostly be Conservative supporters because they wish THEY had the majority rule and if Pierre\'s divide and conquer fear campaign works in 2025 to give him the majority of seats in the election, hold on to your butt because it\'s going to be a bumpy ride for everyone who isn\'t stinking rich in Canada. Austerity and privatization, here we come! Even more than neoLib Trudeau. \n\nDo you really think voting for elitist politicians is going to solve anything? When has that EVER worked? Seriously. When has a Canadian Prime Minister ever solve the systemic issues we face and significantly improved our lives? The ""Greatest Canadian"" was voted years back as Tommy Douglas, who was a politician, but never Prime Minister, he established Medicare in Saskatchewan and then pushed it to the Feds and it got implemented Canada wide by Liberal PM Lester B Pearson in the 60s. That may have have been the last major legislation that helped millions of Canadians over the years get the healthcare they need without going into debt. \n\nBut even that has been eroded over the years by neoLibs and Conservatives, as well as social housing, which is pathetically almost non-existent in Canada - hence a major housing price issue.

"The right is being embraced globally because the left is afraid of sticking to principles that make the common man's life less sufferable. Conservative politics is leaning into the justified anger and distrust and demonstrating a pattern we've seen play out several times in history under various autocratic regimes.

Right wing politicians have simply leveraged the complacency of people like Trudeau who think that GDP is the defining metric of a citizen's standard of living and trickle down economics has a shot of working. (when it never worked to begin with).

The death of actual grassroots journalism, the fact that most voters are geriatric and sitting on baby boomer wealth, and that it has become increasingly harder to vote for marginalized or economically deprived communities all leads to further polarization and less actual discussion on what the least fortunate need from government (which is what government should be all about).

If dumping pollution into the air is cheap for a company, they can make their products cheap and dominate the market. This makes it difficult for cleaner technologies to break into the market which ultimately just hurts everyone. Since tax payers are on the hook to pay for the consequences of pollution anyway, we aren\'t saving money by continuing to pollute. \n\nAdding a cost for polluting means that it is actually cost efficient for companies to try to pollute less. And since the ""tax"" is then given right back to taxpayers, it benefits most people. This the the most right wing way of trying to address climate change imaginable.', ""It's a BS tax.  I wish people would stop spreading lies that Canadians get back more than what they pay.  And even if they did, why bother cutting back if I'm getting all the carbon tax back?...makes no sense and just adds more cost to everything."", ""@@clydemifflin3600 The point is to make it economically viable for companies to stop polluting. For example, let's say a company makes fiber board and as part of the process they emit a bunch of pollution. They could spend money to upgrade their factory to capture that pollution, but that costs money. And since polluting was free, they were incentivized to pollute more, because it's cheaper than trying to prevent it.\n\nThe point of a carbon tax is to give companies an incentive to pollute less without restrictive government policies telling them how to run their business. The government could made that they must do specific factory upgrades. But the government isn't an expert on their type of factory. Maybe the company can find a more effective or cost efficient wat to cut pollution? Since there is now a cost per ton of pollution emitted, they have reason to look into how they can pollute as little as possible. And they don't have some government minister making decisions about how to run their company. \n\nThis is the right wing, capitalist solution to environmental policy. If canadians say they don't want this, the alternative will be the government getting more involved in companies by making rules about what kind of carbon capture they use."", '@@ThatGuy-bz2in Today, CFIB estimates that small businesses pay about 40% of the carbon tax, although they are only eligible for 5% (previously 9%) in rebates.

If they gave the money to businesses, they would eliminate the whole point. The goal is to make polluting expensive and to give them a financial incentive to reduce their pollution. If they can't reduce their pollution, then they need to raise prices. But since the tax goes into the pocket of consumers, it doesn't hurt us.\n\n3) i'm sure there are lots of high pollution companies who are hurt by the tax. But that is because they are finally being made to pay for the expenses they cost. Previously, dumping pollution into the air was totally free for them, but it wasn't for us.

"Canadians traditionally lean to the left and tend to be very naive, believing that politicians represent the best wishes of the underlying population. They are tolerant accepting that there are three distinct ethnic populations in Canada: Native indigenous populations, English and French even though the population overwhelmingly by numbers is tilted in the direction of English. 
    The political agenda has slowly been shifting to a globalist agenda where the elite agenda is creeping to the forefront leaving the Canada first agenda behind. It has reached a point now where Trudeau, not only a PM but a WEFer first has ignored the Canada first agenda in all but hollow talking points and has been aggressively pushing a globalist agenda to the point it is obvious that PM is promoting Schwab's anti democratic agenda at the expense of a made in Canada agenda. Examples that are waking up Canadians from their great slumber and acceptance are:
- the response to health mandates which were draconian
- Climate first, levying a huge carbon tax although Canada represents only 1.89% of global carbon taxes
- Huge deficit government borrowing and spending programs which do not advance Canadian economic growth but results in inflation
- The most onerous of all programs is the immigration invasion which has overloaded Canada's soicial programs with people surplus to Canadian workplace needs and large numbers who do noit have the skillsets, language skills or education to meet the requirements of the workplace.  The result is higher living costs and lower wages. 
- His lax enforcement of law and order has made Canada a safe haven for cirminals while punishing law abiding people from protecting their lives and property

This is what happened when people cover Canadian politics. They do a search, it gives them ONLY opposition party talking points, they use them as if they are complete facts, and simply do not dive further.

In Canada, we have a major dis-information and straight up lying campaign going on.

Ask anyone who hates Trudeau these questions:
-Who closed down Veterans sites and cut Military pensions?
-What party would not have done the EXACT same thing for SNL or WeWork ""scandals""?
-What percentage of the current affordability crisis is around the Carbon Pricing model EXACTLY, and what is inflation? 

Note: over 90% of the issues are inflation related and NOT the Carbon Price, because that is actually very reasonable.

And for the other two, every party would have done the EXACT same thing and anyone saying any different is just lying.

Oh, and it was the CONSERVATIVES that cut Veterans military pensions. Please, ask NON Trudeau supports who THEY think did it.

They will say Trudeau. Due to a poorly-edited video the CPC put out of him saying something else.

That is the basic CPC playbook, cut and splice a talking point, lie about it constantly, hope international news outlets are too dumb to realize it is straight opposition propaganda, and they post it.

"Look, I understand that to put context into every reason why Trudeau is unpopular and the Liberals in general would be difficult. Nobody would watch it. But still, it seems that your narrative of events is really misleading since it is too short.


I follow the UK AND CANADIAN politics news for a while now. I would say there ARE similarities. Like OUT OF TOUCH Prime Ministers. Both Sunak AND TRUDEAU have the same reputation. But the biggest question? Housing. Both Canada AND THE UK somewhat claim (or imply) that they each have THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS in G7. Which cannot be true right? Since worst means one. And there are 2 countries vying for it. So which is it?

Based on my following of Canada's Politics, it all started when Trudeau protected SNC Lavalin by bulldozing his chief Justice whip. She then appeared in the investigation saying that Trudeau ""pressured her"" to drop it. Then she got fired after saying that. A MAJOR BLOW AGAINST Trudeau's ""diverse government"" mantra as she was multi-racial. Then it was followed by the blackface scandal. Basically, Trudeau mocked the black people of his country and their struggles by coloring his skin ""black"" at a party when he was still a High School teacher. That added fuel to the previous sacking of the Justice MP. And that was exposed when he was running for reelection. So the Canadians punished him by letting him win as PM but not giving him a majority (a Hung Parliament I believe is the UK term for it. FYi, I suggested this action to other TLDR videos related to UK politics today and other UK news videos. It is MY SOLUTION to punish the Tories and Labour who consecutively broke the UK economy). So basically, his popularity ended there and it went downhill after that.


The accusation of the Canadian Tories against him on Housing was that he had too many ""gatekeeping policies"" that prevent the building of houses. Lots of red tape and yada yada. They further point out that Canada has a LARGE physical land area. So it should not have restrictions on space to build houses.


On the Carbon tax, this video did not mention the COMPOUNDING reason why Canadians cannot stomach the increases: The PM's HABITUAL VACATION LEISURE TRIPS using the goverment plane. The Canadian Tories are hammering this home. Saying that these Trips ARE THE CAUSE of the large CARBON EMMISSIONS which he then is supposedly combatting by charging the Carbon Tax on Canadians. In other words, he is charging Canadians for trips that HE HIMSELF MADE for a vacation. Not to mention the plane. I also want to add a juicy tidbit. These trips are supposedly being funded by the TRUDEAU FOUNDATION. A non-profit organization. He said that he DIVESTED all his interests from this company. But as it seems, he is using his power to favor said foundation.


Canadians did not just have a fatigue from his long tenure as a leader. He made bad mistakes one after the other. And they got fed up. But unlike the UK which would fire its PM if they were not satisfied, Canadians just went through the motions as there were no decent alternatives. Like Sunak, Trudeau failed to address the plights of the Common Canadian. He was a ""frequent flier"" adding salt to injury and his failed policies like allowance for some dangerous drugs to fester communities and tax raises did not help serve the people.


The world saw the 2015 reputation of Trudeau and retained that image of him. But the Canadian people got stuck not with his reputation but with his governance. And while I admit that he was leaps and bound more charismatic than Sunak (his 2015 image), I cannot blame Canadians for voting him out. Because the Canadian government right now rivals the UK and French Governments for the WORST GOVERNMENTS of their time.",[],2024-06-17T13:18:50Z,@KneeJerkReactor

"Most of what TLDR has stated is accurate.  

The Carbon Tax is actually a Conservate idea.  Carbon taxes have been around for years before Trudeau,  he unleashed it to the general public that, wanted to do something about Climate Change,  don't really understand it.  Carbon taxes are a very effective ways of taxing emissions, but socially it can only be negative when those taxes start to bite.   Everyone is for measures to help the environment, until they have to pay for it.   We all should be honest, we want things that we can't afford and/or don't want to pay for.   In the end we end up paying for things at a much higher price, because we don't make the investments early.    

Trudeau has been in power too long, without a clear mandate.  When this happens, all the faults is what people focus on, since the good stuff just seems routine and inconsequential in comparison. 

Canada's housing issue is the responsibility of the Provincial Governments, not Federal.   No PM will have any power to make real change, because Canadians that have Real Estate, don't want to lose the power (ie Value) they have.  The truth is the free market doesn't fix things on its own...which many of us capitalist believe.  Canada has a low birth rate and with many baby boomers retiring and/or dying, this is creating a squeeze on the country, that many don't realize is coming, till hit really hurts.  Immigration is a solution to this, but creates other issues with housing and this cycle has a great impact on the less wealthy. 

Part of Canada's decline in GDP, is that much of its GDP is due to energy sales.  Decades of manufacturing has shifted to lower cost regions, like the USA south and China.   The GDP is unlikely to change as the World moves increasing faster to renewables, which are lower costs and less harmful to the environment.  

Canadians are caught between a Rock and a Hard place.  On one hand we want to be Environmentalist and have a country that cares for the Earth, on the other hand, our energy resources have a lot of wealth and could afford us many things, in the short term, even though it comes at a cost to the environment.    When it comes to social programs (ie Healthcare and etc) Canadians are pretty much firmly on the left, but with that comes great costs we just don't feel willing to bare.   This isn't a unique situation, as many countries in the EU are suffering the same challenges and are trending to the right. 

It seems improbable that the Liberals and/or Trudeau will win the next Federal Election, on the other hand it is improbable that the Conservatives will be able to change the direction of the country, even with a large majority.   The challenges that Canada is facing requires a level of Unity that the country will struggle to achieve.

"Canadian here.  The current iteration of the federal Liberal Party has become increasingly divorced from the concerns of Canadians.  Increases in carbon taxes during a period of inflation.  Increasing immigration to incredible levels without consulting the provinces on the available housing stock.  Self-promotion as an environmentalist while killing off a popular tax credit for those who use public transit and causing mistrust with Western Canadians whose lively hoods depend on oil and gas.  Unbalanced budgets (unlike the budget surpluses of Liberal Leaders of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin).  Focus on diversity and equity issues but lacking focus on economic fundamentals.  Scandals with WE Charity, serious overspending during the pandemic, and complete gas lighting over the housing crisis putting blame on provinces but not fixing immigration or foreign home ownership rules.  Trudeau came in on the fame of his father's name.  I never voted for him, even though I voted Liberal federally before him.  When he came onto the scene, I asked the question ""Is Justin more like his mum, or his dad?"". I now know the answer.  He has the intelligence of his mother, with the confidence and assuredness of his father.  The reverse would have been so much better.  The federal Liberals are about to experience the same banishment to the political wilderness that their Ontario provincial counterparts experienced.  Rather than learning from that example, they took on the same policy wonks to craft  an agenda that has become elitist, divorced from fundamental priorities, and quite simply shambolic.  The federal Liberals are about to be destroyed in the next election.  They did it to themselves.  As for Pierre Polievre, he has to be very careful with eastern Canada.  What kept the federal Conservatives in minority and opposition for so long is the Reform brand of Conservatives.  His riding with the Freedom Convoy while popular out West, did not resonate with voter rich Quebec and Ontario in the East despite some of the rabble you'll hear on the comments here.","[""American here.\nI didn't realize he INCREASED the carbon taxes during the last couple of years.

"Missing a couple of points.

HE CHANGED THE ELECTION DATE SO THAT ALLIES AND HIS PARLIEMENT MEMBERS GETS PENSIONS.

1. Trudeau has also intervened in many other inquiries to stop investigations. Breached 3 ethics laws.
2. he allowed protesters to burn down churches because protesters were upset, then sent a delegation to native lands that were blocking critical rail routes......a contrast to the emergency act.
3. ArriveCan App: was given to a shell company that had no prior works or competitive contract bid. After charging 130mil $ for something they never got done, they kept receiving contracts.
4. 1bil green slush fund that transfered tax money into an undisclosed account
5. prevented the release of critical documents of election interference for years. Found out thats 5 countries paid MPs (ministers and representatives) and spied on their own countries. He is still refusing to release the documents and the names of those traitors while trying to get the opposition to read those files....a tactic to mussle them because they wouldnt be allowed to do something about those info as they're considered state secrets.
6. Trudeau explicitely said that he didnt do anything about his MP that received China's investment to help him win the election as it would hinder his chances to win that riding...
7. he passed 6-7 anti speech, anti journalism laws. You cannot be mean to MPs anymore, you cannot be SUSPECTED BY ANYONE to maybe have wrong thoughts - for exemple.
8. Turbo Mass migration - 4.5 millions in 3 years (which would be equivalent to 40millions for the US)- was catastrophic for our country. It increased housing price by 2.5 X. From 900 average rent to 2200. It crushed our child care, health care and a record numbers are living under bridges and in the streets, crime has gone up too as a phenomenon called: car theft tourism. Police advised folks that had break ins to let them. Same 60 offenders in BC commited 2000 crimes in a year due to catch and release program. Immigration minister lost track of 1.5millions migrants...
9. Said publicly that protesting to try to change gov policy shouldnt be allowed
10. triple increase in taxes. Carbon X2, capital gains (a whooping 25%).
11. doubled our entire debt. Said he doesnt concern himself about economic policies. Budget will balance itself according to him. He has no plans to balance the budget ever...
12. Chinese officials were allowed into our defense bases that included state secrets and programs.
13. Chinese police stations...

People are angry but do not know who to be angry with. The richest and most powerful people would point at the most stupid reasons. However, if you hear it on a daily basis on TV and everywhere, people would believe it not because it is true but because everyone said so.

"The real reason he is so unpopular currently is the take over of right wing media controlling the Canadian media ecosystem and pulling Trumpian tactics like calling the independent, unbiased or left leaning media ""fake news"". A big part of the problem stems from a previous right wing prime minister Stephen Harper who actually had Pierre Poillievre, the current leader of the right wing ""conservatives"" in his cabinet when he was in office. Harper has since gone on to lead the IDU (International Democratic Union) who is making a point of buddying up with far right dictators and funding and organizing narrative control through media takeover. They also have been interfering in global politics through more nefarious means as Mike Roman who was second in command at the IDU during the time he was assisting Trump with his various fake electors schemes in Georgia and other states and was also a participant in trying to inflame and promote the ""freedumb convoy"" in Canada. The IDU and anybody connected to them are anything but democratic and unless they get the proper bad publicity they have earned they will continue their plans of trying to install far right leaders in as many countries they can to seemingly bring about a global reign of far right authoritarianism. The more you look into the IDU and the people connected to them like PP and Trump the more you see connections to right wing media like ""rebel news"" and ""true north"" along with Faux ""news"" and their effective efforts to pollute the media with a steady stream of disinformation so there is just way too much to fact check and they slip so much through the cracks.
